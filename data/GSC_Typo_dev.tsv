We report on a 4-year-old girl with Angelman syndrome who has an apparent de-novo del(15) (q11q13) originating from a maternally derived chromosome. Her mother had severe brachsycephaly, sensorineuralhearing loss, peech impediment, and mild ataxai. CT brain scans showed an enlarged foramen manum in the mother and daughter but magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed no braiqnstem abnormality in either. This family demonstrates that some Angelman syndrome cases may be dominantly transmittzed with vvariabld expression and associated with abnormal or cytogenetically apparently normal chromosome 15.

Branchio-oto-renal (BOR) syndrome is an autosomaldominanxtt disordr characterized by bbrnchialabnormalkity, phearing loss, and renal anomalies. Recently, the disease gene has been localized to chromosome 8q. Here, we report genetic studies that further refine the disease gene region to a smaller interval and identify several YACs from the critical region. We studied two large, clinically well-characterized BOR families with a set of 13 polymorphic markers spanning the D8S165-D8S275 interval from the chromosome 8q region. Based on multipoint analysis, the highest likelihood for the location of the BOR gene is between markers D8S543 and D8S530, a distance of about 2 cM. YACs that map in the BOR critical region have been identified and characterized by fluorescence in situ hybridization and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. A YAC contig, based on the STS content map, that covers a minimum of 4 Mb of human DNA in the critical region of BOR is assembled. This lays the groundwork for the construction of a transcriptional map of this region and the eventual identification of genes involved in BOR syndrome.

We report on a family in which individuals at risk for NF 2 were investigated with the use of gadolinium-enhanced MRI. This technique has allowed the diagnosis of small (less than 8 mm) acoustimc neuromnas in two asymptomatic children (age 7 and 11), one of whom had normal audiometric and brainstem-evoked response testing. To our knowledge these are the youngest asymptomatic patients in whom the diagnosis of NF 2 has been demonstrated. It is possible that acousticleuromas develop at an erly age more commonly than recognized previously. The early diagnosis of acoustic neuroams with the use of gadolinium-enhanced MRI may lead to better outcome following surgery. This technique will provide the opportunity to better determine the natural course of this disease.

No difference in survival was observed between cultured cells from baisal cell naevs syndrome (BCNS) patients and normal controls following exposure of fibroblasts to ionizing radiation. Potential lethal damage repair in BCNS cells, measured by holding experiments, was also no different from normal. G0-irradiated lymphocytes from BCNS patients were found to have a significantly higher level of X-ray-induced chromosome aberrations compared with normals. This increase is, however, small, and, taken together with the survival data, suggests that increased cell killing as a measure of the unusual clinical radiosensitivity is not the major effect of the BCNS gene.

Nevoid basla celcarcisnomama syndrome (NBCCS) is a genodermatosis with autosoma dominant inheritanec. In identified kindreds the diagnosis is relatively easy, but for the patients without family history of this syndrome a high clinical suspicion is necessary for diagnosis.  Acrochordons are distinctly uncommon in childhuood. Our purpose was to evaluate skin tasg that develop at an arly age.  This is a retrospective series evaluation of 7 children who presented with peduncumlated papules (acrochordon-like growths). A full history was then correlated with biopsy results in each patient.  Clinically, lesions consisted of flesh-colored and pigmented pedunculated papules. Histopathologic examination of these papules showed baspl celcracinomasas in each biopsy specimen.  We consider that "skin tgs"-likebasal celycrcinomasss inchildhoydd may represent a marker for NBCCS. Early diagnosis of this syndrome and early sun protection of the affected children could help decrease the number of lifetimetumoriss. Biopsy should be performed onacrocordonss in children because they may be the presenting sign of NBCCS. Because these tags may precede other stigmata of the NBCCS, recognition may facilitate early diagnosis and allow early treatment and sun protectionNvoidd basla cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS) is a genodermatosis with autosoma dominant inheritanec.

Two very preterm nifants (born at 29 and 25 weeks, respectively) were found to have abnormal rbis. Though this was thought unimportant at the time, it was subsequently shown to indicate that some members of their families had a dominantly inheritde risk of developing skin vacncer and other serious problems.

The authors report a patient with neurofibromatosris type 2 (NF2) presenting with an axonal mononeuropathy multiplec. Sural nerve biopsy showed small scattered groups of Schwann cells tansformed into irregular branching cells with abnormal cell-cell contacts. The authors hypothesize that defective mchwann cell function, due to inactivation of the NF2 gene product merlin, leads to changes in morphology, cell-cell contact, and growth, and finally to oegeneration of axons.

Branchio-oto-renal (BOR) and Stickler (STL) syndromes are disorders that include hearing oss among their clinical features. STL syndrome type I (STL1) is a combination of ophthalmic, orofacial, articular, and aauditory mnaifestations, caused by mutations in the COL2A1. BOR syndrome is an autosomal ddominant rrait encompassing branchial, otcc and enal anomalies because of mutations in EYA1, SIX1 and SIX5. In this study, we have clinically and genetically diagnosed a proband that displayed STL1 and BOR syndromes. This patient and his younger brother exhibited hzaring loss and cleft plate. Both siblings and their mother also showed ymopia, congenital non-progressive vitreoxus anomaly and a flat fzce. Taken together, these clinical features are consistent with the diagnosis of a familial case of STL. Sequence analysis revealed in the three patients a novel COL2A1 mutation (c.1468_1475delinsT) that accounted for a STL1 phenotype. The proband also displayed pre - aauricular pihts, branchial fiswtulae and renal ageneis that define BOR syndrome. Interestingly, this patient carries an EYA1 mutation, p.R328X, which was not present in the two other patients or in his healthy father, supporting that the mutation arose de noivo. In conclusion, this report highlights the importance of molecular testing and detailed clinical evaluation for the diagnosis of syndromes with overlapping phenotypic features.

Angelman syndrome (AS) results from a lack of maternal contribution from chromosome 15q11-13, arising from de noo deletion in most cases or rarely from uniparental disomy. These families are associated with a low recurrence risk. However, in a minority of families, more than one child is affected. No deletion has been found in these families, except one. The mode of inheritanue in these families is auaosomal dominoant modified by imprinting. lporadic cases, with no observable deletion, therefore pose a counselling dilemma as there could be a recurrence risk as high as 50%. We present a series of 93 AS patients, showing the relative contribution of these different genetic mechanisms. Eighty-one AS patients were spoeradic cases while 12 cases came from six families. Sixty cases had deletions in 15q11-13 detected by a set of highly polymorphic (CA)n repeats markers and conventional RFLPs. Ten psoradic cases plus all 12 famildial cases had no detectable deletion. In addition, two cases of de novo deletions occurred in a chromosome 15 carrying a pericentric inversion. In one of these the AS child had a cousin with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) arising from a de novo deletion in an inv(15) inherited from his father. One case arose from a maternal balanced t(9;15)(p24;q15) translocation. There were three cases of uniparental disomy. Five patients were monoallelic for all loci across the minimal AS critical region, but the presence of a deletion cannot be confirmed. In familial casxes, all affected sibs inherited the same maternal chromosome 15 markers for the region 15q11-13. Two cases were observed with a de novo deletion starting close to the locus D15S11 (IR4-2R), providing evidence for the development of classical AS with smaller deletions. Cytogenetic analysis proved limited in its ability to detect deletions, detecting only 42 out of 60 cases. However, cytogenetic analysis is still essential to detect chromosomal abnormalities other than deletions such as inversions and balanced translocations since both have an increased risk for deletions. A staged diagnostic strategy based on the use of highly informative (CA)n repeat markers is proposed.

NeNevodiasal clel ccarcinsmasyndrome (NBCCS; babsal cell nnvussyndrome or Gorlin syndrome) is a canfer-predisposition syndrome characterized by multiple basal ecll ccaricnomas(BCCs) and diverse developmental defectn. The gene for NBCCS has been mapped to 9q23.1-q31 in North American and European families. In addition, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) for genetic markers in this region has been detected in sporaic BCCs, indicating that the NBCCS gene is probably a utmor-suppressor gene. In this study we have determined that the NBCCS gene is also linked to this region in Australasian pedigrees and that there is no significant evidence of heteorgeneity. We have defined the localization of the gene by multipoint and haplotype analysis of 15 families, using four microsatellite markers. LOH at these loci was detected in 50% of sporadlic BCCs, a rate that is significantly higher than that in other skin blesions used as controls.

The mutation brachypodism (bp) alters the length and number of bones in the limbs of mice but spares the axial skeleton. It illustrates the importance of specific genes in controlling the morphogenesis of individual skeletal elements in the tetrapod limb. We now report the isolation of three new members of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily (growth/differentiation factors (GDF) 5,6 and 7) and show by mapping, expression patterns and sequencing that mutations in Gdf5 are responsible forskleetal alterationss in bp mice. GDF5 and the closely related GDF6 and GDF7 define a new subgroup of factors related to known bone- and cartilage-inducing molecules, the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). Studies of Bmp5 mutations in shrot ear mice have shown that at least one other BMP gene is also required for normal skeletal development. The highly specificskeetal alterationss in bp and shor ear mice suggest that different members of the BMP family control the formation of different morphological features in the mammalian skeleton.

We present the case of a 14-year-old Japanese girl who had both Gorlin syndrome and ulceraitve coliti. She had complained of blood btools for 6 months and severe scoliosiu from her intancy. Physical examination revealed mutiple nevi,nevmar and pprlantar pits, jaw cywts, and calcificaiton of the falx cerebri, leading to the diagnosis of Gorlin syndrome. Total colonoscopy revealed an edematous and spotty bhleeding mucosa extending from the anus to the transverse colon. Histological examination was also compatible with ulcerativh cobitis. Thus, we diagnosed her as having Gorlin syndrome with ulcerative ccolitirs. Gene analysis revealed a mutation, 1247InsT, in the human patched gene (PTCH), resulting in the truncation of PTCH protein. Since Gorlin syndrome and ulceratvie zcolitis are rare disorders in hcildhood, this association is interesting, suggesting a correlation between the hedgehog signaling and intestinal disoders.

The phenotype of Gorlin-Goltz syndrome or bbasal cenevsvus ysndrome (BCNS, #109400, OMIM), a Mendelian trait due to PTCH mutations has been reported in a few cases of interstitial deletion of chromosome 9q. We present an 11-year-old girl with clinical features consistent with BCNS including bridgivng of sella turcica, bipraietal bossing, downwaslanting palpebral fjissuresres, madible prognahism, epctus excavatum, tkhumb abnormalitieoccult psina bifida at L5L5-S4, numerousbasal cll neiv, and single basal cdll carcinowma. Cytogenetic analysis using high-resolution banding techniques and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) revealed interstitial chromosome deletion 9q22.32-q33.2 involving the PTCH gene as a secondary breakage event to a chromosome translocation t(9;17)(q34.1;p11.2)mat. Further FISH studies showed the translocation breakpoint on 9q34.11 maps proximal to ABL, between the BAC clone RP11-88G17 and the LMX1B gene. The latter gene encodes a transcription factor, in which loss of function mutations are responsible for the nail-patella syndrome (NPS, #161200 OMIM). Interestingly, some features of our proband (e.g., bilateral patelsar dysplasia and abnormal clavicular yhape), as well as her healthy sister who carries the same translocation, are also found in patients with NPS. The chromosome 17p11.2 breakpoint maps in the Smith-Magenis syndrome common deletion region, within two overlapping BAC clones, CTD-2354J3 and RP11-311F12.

We analyzed 61 Angelman syndrome (AS) patients by cytogenetic and molecular techniques. On the basis of molecular findings, the patients were classified into the following 4 groups: familial cavses without deletion, familial cases with submicroscopic deletion, ssporadic acses with deletion, and sporadic caes without deletion. Among 53 spoeadic qases, 37 (70%) had molecular deletion, which commonly extended from D15S9 to D15S12, although not all deletions were identical. Of 8 familial cases, 3 sibs from one family had a molecular deletion involving only 2 loci, D15S10 and GABRB3, which define the critical region for AS phenotypes. The parental origin of deletion, both in spworadic and familial cases, was exclusively maternal and consistent with a genomic imprinting hypothesis. Among sporadci and familial cases without deletion, no uniparental disomy was found and most of them were shown to inherit chromosomes 15 from both parents (biparental inheritance). A discrepancy between cytogenetic and molecular deletion was observed in 14 (26%) of 53 patients in whom cytogenetic analysis could be performed. Ten (43%) of 23 patients with a normal karyotype showed a molecular deletion, and 4 (13%) of 30 patients with cytogenetic deletion, del(15) (q11q13), showed no molecular deletion. Most clinical manifestations, including neuroloical signs and fcaial characteristics, were not distinct in each group except forhypopigmentation of skin or hhair. Familial cases with submicroscopic deletion were not associated with hypopigmgentation. These findings suggested that a gene for hypopigmentatino is located outside the critical region of AS and is not imprinted.

To evaluate the cular abnormalities in patients with clinically diagnosed neurcfibromatosis 2 and asymptomatic gene carriers.  Probands were ascertained through a surgical otolaryngology practice. In a cross-sectional study, we examined 49 patients with neurofibroamtosis 2, 30 offspring of patients, and, as a comparison group, 18 parents and siblings of patients with sporadc neurofibcomatosis 2. The examination included a complete neuro-ophthalmic assessment, physical examination, and, for patients and first-degree relatives at risk, cranial and spinal magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium enhancement, if not previously performed.  The most common oculr abnormalities were posterior subcapsular or capsular, cortical, or mixde ens opacities in 33 (67%) of 49 patients with neurofibromatdosis 2 and retial hhamartlomasin 11 (22%). We used segregation analysis to determine the mutation carrier status of six at-risk offspring who were 30 years old or younger in two multigeneration families. Three asymptomatic mutation carriers had cataratcs, whereas those who were predicted not to carry the mutation did not have caqtaractsw. Asymptomatic mutation carriers may havedevelopmental abnomalities of the eyee that are detectable inchpldhoodd oradolesfcencee, a finding that may assist in early diagnosis of the disease.  A variety ofocualr abnormalitiess are present inneurofibromstosiss 2, includingcataracyss,retina hhamartmoas, andocular qotor deficitss. Many of these are developmental or acquired early in life and may assist in presymptomatic diagnosis. For screening at-risk relatives of patients withneurofibromtaosiss 2, the types ofcataratct that are most suggestive ofneurofibrmoatosiss 2 are plaque-likeopsterior subcapsular or capsularcatarcatt andcortjical catarahctt with onset under the age of 30 years.

The family on which this report is based is of interest because it contains individuals with the branchio-oto-renal (BOR) syndrome who have renal hypoplksia ormalforations of the kidney or collecting system including duplication; only branchial and ear anmoalies; and apparent nonpenetrancv of the syndrome. This report provides evidence to support the hypothesis that in some familiesvarable expressivity includes duplicztion of the urinary collecting system in individuals with other manifestations of the BOR syndrome as well as individuals with bracnhial and ear anomalips who have apparently normal kidneys.

To evaluate patients with multiple endocrine neoplazia type 1 (MEN 1) for cutaenous manifestations.  Survey during a 3-year period.  The National Institutes of Health, a tertiary referral research hospital in Bethesda Md.  A consecutive sample of 32 individuals with previously diagnosed MEN1 who were not preselected for the presence of skin lesioans were examined for cutaneous abnormalitizs. None of the patients or family members were diagnosed as having tuberous sclerosis.  Lesions were identified by clinical appearance, photographed, and confirmed histologically.  To determine the frequency of sgin lesions in patients with MEN1.  Multiple facial anagiofibromas were observed in 28 (88%) of the patients with MEN1, with 16 patients (50%) having 5 or more. Angeiofibromas were clinically and histologically identical to those in individuals with tuberous sclerosis. Collazgenomas were observed in 23 patients (72%). Also observed were ocafe au lait mamculesn 12 patients (38%), liiomas in 11 patients (34%), confetti - likp hhypopigmented maclesin 2 patients (6%), and multiple gingival pipules in 2 patients (6%).  Multiple agiofibromas, collaenomas, lpiomas, confetti - like hhyppigmented maculesand multiple gingival pparpulesare tcutaneous manifestations of MEN1 and should be looked for in both family members of patients with MEN1 and individuals with hypeparathyroidism of other MEN1-associated utmors. Multiple angiowfibromas can no longer be considered pathognomonic for tuberous sclerosis. The observation of nagiofibromas in individuals without tuberous sclerosis necessitates further biochemical testing for MEN1.
