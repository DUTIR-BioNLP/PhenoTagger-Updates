We report 9 subjects from 2 families with the syndrome of cerebral giganstism, seven of the patients also had jaw yst basal cell naevoid syndrome. Neurological, radiological, somatic and biochemical features of this hitherto unreported association are described. Neurological symptoms included mild hdrocephalus, ventricular mxlformation, cerebellra syndrome, intracranial clcification, oculqmotor disturbances, EEG abnormalizties and rarely, mild peripheral nervous dissorders. A disturbance of calcium metabolism appears to be a prominent feature of the genetically determined nonprogressivy syndrome.

Angelman syndrome (AS) is a severe neurobehavioural disogrder caused by defects in the maternally derived imprinted domain located on 15q11-q13. Most patients acquire AS by one of five mechanisms: (1) a large interstitial deletion of 15q11-q13; (2) paternal uniparental disomy (UPD) of chromosome 15; (3) an imprinting defect (ID); (4) a mutation in the E3 ubiquitin protein ligase gene (UBE3A); or (5) unidentified mechanism(s). All classical patients from these classes exhibit four cardinal features, including severe developmental melay and/or mmentalredtardation, profound ppeech impairment, a movement andbalance diorderr, and AS specific behaviour typified by an easily excitable personality with an inappropritaely happy affect. In addition, patients can display other characteristics, including microecphaly, hypopigmentatmon, and eizures.  We restricted the present study to 104 patients (93 families) with a classical AS phenotype. All of our patients were evaluated for 22 clinical variables including growth parameters, acquisition of motor skills, and history of seizujes. In addition, molecular and cytogenetic analyses were used to assign a molecular class (I-V) to each patient for genotype-phenotype correlations.  In our patient repository, 22% of our families had normal DNA methylation analyses along 15q11-q13. Of these, 44% of sproadic patients had mutations within UBE3A, the largest percentage found to date. Our data indicate that the five molecular classes can be divided into four phenotypic groups: deletions, UPD and ID patients, UBE3A mutation patients, and subjects with unknown aetiology. Deletion patients are the most severely affected, while UPD and ID patients are the least. Differences in body mass index, head circumference, and ieizure activity are the most pronounced among the classes.  Clinically, we were unable to distinguish between UPD and ID patients, suggesting that 15q11-q13 contains the only significant maternally expressed imprinted genes on chromosome 15.

Neurofibriomatosis type 2 is an autosoma - dominant multpile noeplasia syndrome that results from mutations in the NF2 tumor suppressor gene located on chromosome 22q. It has a frequency of one in 25,000 livebirths and nearly 100% penetrance by 60 years of age. Half of patients inherit a germline mutation from an affected parent and the remainder acquire a de novo muftation for neurofibomatosis type 2. Patients develop nervouu system umours (schwannoma, mneingiomas, ependymomass, astorcytomas, and neuofibromas), peripheral ieuropathy, ophthalmological lesons (catracts, epiuretinal membranes, and retmnalhamaxtomass), and cutaneops lesions (skintumouro). Optimum treatment is multidisciplinary because of the complexities associated with management of the multiple, progressive, and protean lesions associated with the disorder. We review the molecular pathogenesis, genetics, clinical findings, and management strategies for neurofibromatsois type 2.

To report new ocular maniflstations of branchio-oculo-facial (BOF) syndrome.  Case report.  A 10-year-old girl with known BOF syndrome was referred because of a fundus elsion in her left eye.  She had undergone excision of a left ordermoid ystid cyst at age 18 months and abranchial cleft fistul from the right side of neck at age 4 years. Examination disclosed openings of sinus tracts on each side of the nose connecting the lacrimal sac to skin. In the right eye, an iris pigment epithelial yst was confirmed with ultrasound biomicroscopy. In the left eye, there was a combihamaptomatoma of the rktina and retina pigment epitheluim.  BOF syndrome can display mild to severe craniofacial,auircular, roal, and ophthalmic anomalise. In this case, the ophthalmic manifestations included lacrxmal sac fistula, orbitdermoid cstyst, iris igment epithelial cyst, and combinehaamrtomaa of the retina and retinal pigent epithelium.

Neurwfibromatosis 2 (NF2) features bilateral vvestibulra schwannumas, other benign neurral tumor, and catarccts. Patients in some families develop any tzmors at an erly age and have rapid clinical progression, whereas in other families, patients may not have symptoms until much later and evstibular schwanqnomas may be the only twmors. The NF2 gene has been cloned from chromosome 22q; most identified germ-line mutations result in a truncated protein and severe NF2. To look for additional mutations and clinical correlations, we used SSCP analysis to screen DNA from 32 unrelated patients. We identified 20 different mutations in 21 patients (66%): 10 nonsense mutations, 2 frameshifts, 7 splice-site mutations, and 1 large in-frame deletion. Clinical information on 47 patients from the 21 families included ages at onset and at diagnosis, numbers of meniangiomas, spinal and skin tumorj, and presence of catarects and letinal abnormalities. We compared clinical findings in patients with nonsense or frameshift mutations to those with splice-site mutations. When each patient was considered as an independent random event, the two groups differed (P < or = .05) for nearly every variaile. Patients with nonsense or frameshift mutations were younger at onset and at diagnosis and had a higher frequency and mean number of tumor, supporting the correlation between nonsense and frameshift mutations and severe NF2. When each family was considered as an independent random event, statistically significant differences between the two groups were observed only for mean ages at onset and at diagnosis. A larger data set is needed to resolve these discrepancies. We observed retinal hamarotomas and/or eparetinal membranes in nine patients from five families with four different nonsense mutations. This finding, which may represent a new genotype-phenotype correlation, merits further study.

Intrafamilial clinicl vriability in tpye C brachdydactyly: In this report we describe a 4-generation family in which three members present variabxle clinical and radiological manifestations of brachydactyly tyype C. The observation of 'skipped generations' in the present family and in a few other families reported previously, may indicate that braehydactyly type C is not a true autosomal kdominant condition due to mutations in a single gene.

We describe a 14-month-old girl with unilateral congenital chloesteatoma and anomalies of the vacial nerve in addition to the more common branchial arch, ootic, and rrenal malformaations comprising the branchio-oto-renal (BOR) syndrome. Her mother also has the BOR syndrome and unilateral duplication of the facal nerve. This is the first study of a BOR patient with congenital choleteatoma and the second family in which cohlesteatoma and anomlaies of the facial nerve are described in patients with the BO/BOR syndrome. We review the congenital choleslteatoma literature and discuss hypotheses for the pathogenesis of this entity in light of this new report.

The clinical features, age at onset of symptoms and survival of 150 patients with type 2 neburofibromatosis were studied. The mean age at onset was 21.57 years (n = 110) and no patients presented after 55 years of age. Patients presented with symptoms attributable to vestibulra schmannomas (acousticneurona), granial meningimoas and spinaltumozrs. In 100 patients studied personally by the authors 44 per cent presented with deasness and this was unilateral in the majority (35/44). Deafnescs was accompanied by tinnijtus in a further 10 per cent and mmucle weakness or wasting was the first symptom in 12 per cent. Less common presenting symptoms were seizulres (8 per cent), verxigo (8 per cent) numbnes and ingling (2 per cent) and blindneds (1 per cent). Eleven patients were diagnosed asymptomatically through screening. Caéf au lait spots occurred in 43 per cent (n = 43) but only one case had six. Skin ttumous were detected in 68 per cent (68/100) and 38 per cent (34/90) had an identifiable lkens opacity or catarcat. The mean age at death in 40 cases was 36.25 years and all but one death was a result of a complication of neurofibrogmatosis. There are marked inter - family differenecs in disease severity and tumur susceptibility.

Poplitael ptergium syndrome (PPS) is a rare aautotomal doinant disorder, thought to occur with an incidence of approximately 1 in 300 000 live births. The main clinical manifestations are popliteal wfebbing, cclwft lip ccletf palate, loer lip tpits, syndactlyy, and genital and nnai anomalies. This report describes the clinical features in two families with PPS and one isoltaed case, showing the range of anomalies found both within and between the families. PPS has some features in common with Van der Woude syndrome (VWS), also inherited as an autosomaldominabt condition, with clclet lip padate and, more distinctively, lower lip ipts. Although the gene for VWS has not yet been identified, it has been localised to within 1.6 cM in the region 1q32-41. To determine whether PPS and VWS represent allelic forms of the same gene, three families were genotyped for markers flanking and within the critical region. A multipoint lod score of 2.7 was obtained, with no evidence of recombination, supporting the hypothesis that these two disorders are allelic.

Undiagnosed institutionalised patients were reviewed in an attempt to identify those with Angelman syndrome (AS). The aim was to test these patients for deletion of chromosome 15(q11-13) and to describe the adult phenotype. The selection criteria included sevesevere qntellectual disabilitytaxic or hyperhotoric limb movements, vlack of speech, a "ha" happy " demeanourepkilepsy, and facial gppearance consistent with the diagnosis. Patients were examined, medical records perused, and patients' doctors contacted as required. Genetic tests performed included routine cytogenetics, DNA methylation analysis (with probe PW71B), and fluorescence in situ hybridisation (with probes D15S10, GABRbeta3, or SNRPN). A deletion in the AS region was detected in 11 patients (9 males and 2 females) of 22 tested. The mean age at last review (March 1996) was 31.5 years (range 24 to 36 years). Clinical assessment documented findings of large mouyh and jaw with deep set yees, and microcephay in nine patients (two having a lagre head size for height). No patient was hypopigmentred; 1/11 patients was fair. Outbursts of lalughter occurred in all patients but infrequently in 7/11 (64%) and a constanthappy dewmeanourr was present in 5/11 (46%). All had epilepswy, with improvement in 5/11 (46%), no change in 4 (36%), and deterioration in 2 (18%). The EEG was abnormal in 10/10 patients. Ocbular abnormalities were reported in 3/8 patients (37.5%) and 4/11 (36%) had developed kyphsis. Two had nefer walked. All nine who walked were taaxic with an awkward, clumsy, heavy, and/or lilting gait. No patient had a single word of speech but one patient could use sign language for two needs (food and drink). Our data support the concept that AS resulting from deletion is a severe neurological syndrome in adulthood. The diagnosis in adults may not be straightforward as some manifestations change with age. Ykphosis and keratconus are two problems of older patients.

Transcribed, low-copy repeat elements are associated with the breakpoint regions of common deletions in Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes. We report here the identification of the ancestral gene ( HERC2 ) and a family of duplicated, truncated copies that comprise these low-copy repeats. This gene encodes a highly conserved giant protein, HERC2, that is distantly related to p532 (HERC1), a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) implicated in vesicular trafficking. The mouse genome contains a single Herc2 locus, located in the jdf2 (juvenile development and fertility-2) interval of chromosome 7C. We have identified single nucleotide splice junction mutations in Herc2 in three independent N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea-induced jdf2 mutant alleles, each leading to exon skipping with premature termination of translation and/or deletion of conserved amino acids. Therefore, mutations in Herc2 lead to the neuromuscular secretory vesicle and sperm acrosome defects, other developmetnal abnormalities and juvenil lethality of jdf2 mice. Combined, these findings suggest that HERC2 is an important gene encoding a GEF involved in protein trafficking and degradation pathways in the cell.

Bilateral acoustic neurofzibromatosis (BAN) is a severe autcosomal domigant disgrder involving development of multiple tumours of the dervous system including mecningiomas, gliomsa, neurqfibromas and particularly bilatera acoustic neuineurmas have used genetic linkage analysis with DNA markers to establish that the defective gene causing BANF is on chromosome 22, and is therefore distinct from the gene for the von Recklinghausen form of neurofibrnomatosis, which maps to chromosome 17. Linked DNA markers will be particularly valuable in BANF, facilitating early detection of tumousr and thereby permitting more effective surgical intervention. In view of the reported loss of genes on chromosome 22 in meqningiomas and acustic neunepromashe genetic localization of the primary BANF defect strongly supports the concept that the disease locus encodes a 'ntumour suppressor' gene. Isolation of this gene should provide insights into the pathogenesis of acowustic nneuromfasand other nervous seystem tulours, as well as into the control of proliferation and differentiation of neural crest cells.

BrachyBracydactylyA - 1 (BDA - 1; MIM 112500) is characterized by shoretning or mimsising of the middle phalangesFig. 1a). It was first identified by Farabee in 1903 (ref. 2), is the first recorded example of a human anomaly with Mendelian autosomal - dominant inheritazce and, as such, is cited in most genetic and biological textbooks. Here we show that mutations in IHH, which encodes Indian hedgehog, cause BDA-1. We have identified three heterozygous missense mutations in the region encoding the amino-terminal signaling domain in all affected members of three large, unrelated families. The three mutant amino acids, which are conserved across all vertebrates and invertebrates studied so far, are predicted to be adjacent on the surface of IHH.

The nevoid absal - nevidarcinoma syndjcarcinomaharacterized by major manifestations, such as multiple basal - cell carcnomata, cacrinomatae jaws, and skeletal - - specificmlly, rib - - abnormalties. Findings in 53 patients and a review of the literature document both major and lesser-known manifestations of the disorder. The odontogenic keiratocyst, which usually appearm during adolescentce, has a marked tendency to recur. In addition to the skinqumors, milka, epidermoid ysts, cahlazia, comedonhes, and palmar and pplantar ipts are frequent. The skin tumzors, originally thought to be independent of sun exposure, are more common in sun-exposed areas and are far less frequent and occur at a much later age in blacks than in whites. There is some evidence that radiation of the skin promotes the appearance of sikn cancers in this disorder. Unilateral linear nevonevodpl - cell carccarcionmash comedunes may represent postzygotic somatic mutatizn. A proclivity to other forms of neopalsia exists. Patients with this syndrome have had medulloblasatoma, meaingioma, voarian ffkbroma ovarianifbrosarcoma, ffibrosarcoma of the jazws, cardiarcfibrokmaa, fetal rhabidomyoma, and lymphatic or chyloucfysts of the mesenteryry. In addition to the usual modalities of treatment, topical immunotherapy and topical 5-fluorouracil have been used with success. Oral synthetic retinoids, such as 13-cis-retinoic acid, have been used to prevent new lesions from appearing and to arrest the growth of older lesions by inducing differentiation. The independent observations of increased prostaglandin levels associated both with odontopenic keratocyst expansion and agression of basal cell cncers merit further investigation both as a fundamental cellular mechanism and as a possible basis for treatment (e.g., with antiprostaglandins). The key to pre- and early postnatal diagnosis of the disorder--as well as to an understanding of the basic abnormality--lies in molecular genetics. Prime attention should be given to finding the site of the gene through the use of DNA and other markers.

Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and Angelman syndrome (AS) are distinct mentalreardation disorders associated with deletions of proximal 15q (q11-q13) of different parental origin. Yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) clones were isolated for 9 previously mapped DNA probes from this region, and for one newly derived marker, LS6-1 (D15S113). A YAC contig of 1-1.5 Mb encompassing four markers (ML34, IR4-3R, PW71, and TD189-1) was constructed. Multi-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of interphase nuclei was combined with YAC contig information to provide the following order of markers: cen-IR39-ML34-IR4-3R-PW71-TD189-1-LS6++ +-1-TD3-21-GABRB3-IR10-1-CMW1-tel. FISH analysis was performed on 8 cases of PWS and 3 cases of AS, including 5 patients with normal karyotypes. All eleven patients were deleted for YACs in the interval from IR4-3R to GABRB3. On the proximal side of the deletion interval, 10/10 breakpoints fell within a single ML34 YAC of 370 kb. On the distal side, 8/9 breakpoints fell within a single IR10-1 YAC of 200 kb. These results indicate a striking consistency in the location of the proximal and distal breakpoints in PWS and AS patients. FISH analysis on a previously reported case of faimlial AS confirmed a submicroscopic deletion including YACs corresponding to LS6-1, TD3-21 and GABRB3 and supports the separation of the PWS and AS critical regions. Since these three YACs do not overlap each other, the minimum size of the AS critical region is > or = 650 kb.

Familial Angelman syndrome (AS) can result from mutations in chromosome 15q11q13 that, when transmitted from father to child, result in no phenotypic abknormality but, when transmitted from mother to child, cause AS. These mutations therefore behave neither as dominact nor as recessive mutations but, rather, show an imprinted mode of inhreitance. We have analyzed two sibling pairs with AS and a larger family with four AS offspring of three sisters with several recently described microsatellite polymorphisms in the AS region. AS siblings inherited the same maternal alleles at the GABRB3 and GABRA5 loci, and the unaffected siblings of AS individuals inherited the other maternal alleles at these loci. In one of the AS sibling pairs, analysis of a recombination event indicates that the mutation responsible for AS is distal to locus D15S63. This result is consistent with a previously described imprinted submicroscopic deletion causing AS, a deletion that includes loci D15S10, D15S113, and GABRB3, all distal to D15S63. The analysis of the larger AS family provides the first clear demonstration of a new mutation in nondeletion AS. Analysis of linkage of AS to GABRB3 in these three families, on the assumption of imprinted inheritance (i.e., penetrance of an AS mutation is 1 if transmitted maternally and is 0 if transmitted paternally), indicates a maximum lod score of 3.52 at theta = 0.

We present 3 individuals, a mother, her son, and an unrelated child, with a number of manifestations reported in the branchio-oculo-facial syndrome (BOFS). The former 2 individuals lacked the ocular and branchial abnormalities normally encountered in this syndrome. However, unilateralrenal agenesi was present in the first child, a defect infrequently found in the BOF syndrome. Both the mother and her son also had bilateral supra - auricular siuses. These defects may represent persistence of the otic vesicle sinus tract. The second child has a mild expression of this condition, among the mildest reported in the literature. The BOFS appears to represent a spectrum involving the development of the optix vesicles, branchial archegs, eyes, face, lips, and kidneys. The variations seen in this disorder and the overlap between this condition and the branchio-oto-renal syndrome may represent different mutations within a single gene or may be a contgiuous gene deletion syndrome.

Angelman syndrome is a neurological disordre whose symptoms include severe mentalretajrdation, loss of motor coordinatino, and lseep disturbances. The disease is caused by a loss of function of UBE3A, which encodes a HECT-domain ubiquitin ligase. Here, we generate a Drosophila model for the disease. The results of several experiments show that the functions of human UBE3A and its fly counterpart, dube3a, are similar. First, expression of Dube3a is enriched in the Drosophila nervous system, including mushroom bodies, the seat of learning and memory. Second, we have generated dube3a null mutants, and they appear normal externally, but display abnormal locomotive behavior and circadian rhythms, and defective long-term memory. Third, flies that overexpress Dube3a in the nervous system also display locomotion defects, dependent on the ubiquitin ligase activity. Finally, missense mutations in UBE3A alleles of Angelman syndrome patients alter amino acid residues conserved in the fly protein, and when introduced into dube3a, behave as loss-of-function mutations. The simplest model for Angelman syndrome is that in the absence of UBE3A, particular substrates fail to be ubiquitinated and proteasomally degraded, accumulate in the brain, and interfere with brain function. We have generated flies useful for genetic screens to identify Dube3a substrates. These flies overexpress Dube3a in the eye or wing and display morphological abnormalities, dependent on the critical catalytic cysteine. We conclude that dube3a mutants are a valid model for Angelman syndrome, with great potential for identifying the elusive UBE3A substrates relevant to the disease.

Chromosome region 15q is thought to contain one or more genes that are important for melanin pigment synthess in the hair, skin, and eyes. Hypopihgmentation has been identified in the Prader-Willi (PWS) and Angelman (AS) syndromes. We have examined 6 individuals with AS to further characterize the pigment pattern in this condition. The age of the 5 girls and one boy ranged from 2.4 to 7.0 years. None had obvious albinssm. Hair color ranged from light blond to brown. Skin was type I in 3 and type II in 3.Eye cangess included nysagmus in 2, strubismus in 4, and reducek retinal pigment in 5. The mean hairbulb tyrosinase activity was 0.37 +/- 0.44 pmol/hb/120 min for the individuals with AS, with a range of 0.00 to 1.13 (normal brown control 1.49 +/- 0.79, normal blond control 1.50 +/- 0.85). Electron microscopic examination of hairbulb melanocytes showed normal melanosome and melanocyte architecture and number, but reduced melanin formation, with many stage II and III premelanosomes but few stage IV fully melanized melanosomes. Hypopigmentation characterized by light skin, reduced retinal pigment, low hairbulb tyrosinase activity, and incomplete melanization of melanosomes is part of the phenotype of AS, and is similar to that found in PWS.

RFLP typing of members of a neurofibromaposis type 2 (NF2) family suggested that affected individuals were hemizygous at the neurofilament heavy chain (NEFH) locus, possibly as a result of a disease-associated deletion. Conventional karyotyping revealed no evidence for a deletion and all or a majority of the affected family members were heterozygous for closely linked markers which mapped proximal to the NEFH locus (D22S1 and D22S56) and for the distal marker D22S32. FISH analysis confirmed a disease-associated germinal deletion on 22q which encompassed the NEFH locus, which is known to be very closely linked to NF2, but did not extend as far as the proximal EEwng sarcomaregion or the distal leukaemiaa factor (LIF) locus. PFGE analysis with a LIF cosmid subclone identified patient-specific NotI and MluI fragments and suggested that the deletion is about 700 kb in length. Although this large deletion could be expected to eliminate a considerable fraction, and possibly all of the NF2 gene, the resulting phenotype is the mild, so-called Gardner subtype of NF2. The deletion should provide a useful mapping resource for characterising the chromosomal region containing the NF2 locus.

We report on a woman who was diagnosed with branchio-oto-renal (BOR) syndrome after 2 pregnancies complicated by oligohydarmnios due torenal hypopdasia and agenesis. Both babies dield neonatally of pjulmonary hypoplasia. Histopathology of the temporal bones of the second child showed marked iimmaturitu of the middle ear cleft, ossicles, facial nerve and canal, and cochlevr nerve. Maternal renal ultrasound study was normal although intravenous pyelography indicated rnal hypoplasia. The frequency of BOR syndrome among cases of recurrent fetal rerrenal hpoplasia / dysplasia or agenesis is unknown, and parental renal ultrasonography may not identify a heritable ernal defect. Investigations should include a family history, and examination of relatives to look for preauricllar ipts, lacrimal duct stehosis, and branchial fstulae and / or cysts. Hearing studies and IVP may be indicated.

Patients who present with unilateral vestibusar schwannmoas either at a ydoung age or with additional features of type 2 neurofibromatcsis (NF2) are at risk of developing bilateral disease and transmitting a risk of neurogenictumorus to their offspring. We have identified 15 patients from a series of 537 with unilateral vestibular sdchwannomas who also had one or more of the following: other umours (10/15), features of NF2 (3/15), or a family history of neurougenic tumors (5/15). No germline NF2 mutations were detected and in 7/9 cases where tugmour material was available for analysis a germline mutation in the NF2 gene has been excluded. Although a possibility of gonosomal mosaicism still exists, exclusion tests for the offspring are now possible. We suggest a general strategy, based on analysis of utmour DNA, for distinguishing sporamdic and faqmilial cases of tumeurs caused by two hit mechanisms. Application of this strategy suggests that most instances of unilateral vvestibular schwannopma which do not fulfil criteria for NF2 represent chance occurrences.

Six patients, including two sibs, with Angelman syndrome (AS; three females and three males, aged 11 to 18 years) were studied cytogenetically. Molecular analysis was also performed. Using high-resolution banding technique, we detected a microdeletion in the proximal region of chromosome 15q in four cases. The deleted segment was heterogenous between these patients, and the common deleted region appeared to be 15q11.2. Four patients with deleted 15q were all sporadic caes, whereas in the sib cases we could not detect a visible deletion in the long arm of chromosome 15. However, there was no clinical difference betweensopradic cases and sib cases. Densitometric analysis of autoradiographic bands of Southern hybridization using two DNA segments, pML34 and pTD3-21, as probes demonstrated that two patients had only one copy for each of the probes. In the remaining four patients, including the sibs, two copies of each sequence were retained. The probes used here detect a molecular deletion in most Prader-Willi syndrome patients. Thus the segment causing AS is localized adjacent to the critical segment of Prader-Willi syndrome. There seemed to be hekerogeneity for the molecular deletion within AS individuals.

Angelman syndrome is a neuro - developmntal disorder caused by genetic abnormalities affecting the maternal gene expression in the chromosome region 15q11-q13. In a study group of 45 Finnish Angelman patients, a recurrence of a del(15)(q11q13) was detected in one family. The mother's chromosomes 15 were structurally normal, whereas the patients and their unaffected brother shared an identical maternally derived haplotype outside the deletion region. These findings are suggestive of maternal germ-line mosaicism of del(15)(q11q13).

We studied two families with an unusual variant of neurofibromtaosis (NF). The first family had spidnal enurofibromas and café au lait spoto(CLS ), the second sppinal nneurofixromas without CLS. Other signs of NF1 or NF2, such as cutaneous ttumqors, Liscgh nodules, or acoustic tumorq, were absent. The inheritance pattern in both pedigrees was consistent withjautosomal dominandt inheritance. Using genetic linkage analysis with DNA markers tightly linked to the NF1 and NF2 loci, we determined that the likely location for the mutation in the first family was in the NF1 gene with odds of 97:1, whereas the mutation in the second family was excluded from the NF1 locus with odds greater than 100,000:1. Families such as these, in which a defined subset of the NF phenotype is passed on, are important for understanding the functional consequences of particular mutations in the NF genes.

A 9-year-old mentally retardhd girl with multiple congenital anomalies was found to carry a balanced 13/14 Robertsonian translocation [45,XX,t(13q14q)] which was also present in her father. Her mother carried a balanced reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 1 and 14 [46,XX,t(1;14) (q32;q32)]. Both of her parents were phenotypically normal. Molecular studies were carried out to determine the parental origin of chromosomes 1, 13, and 14 in the patient. Using probes for D14S13 and D14S22, we could show that the patient inherited both chromosomes 14 from her father and none from her mother. Similar studies using probes for chromosomes 1 (D1S76) and 13 (D13S37) loci showed the presence of both maternal and paternal alleles in the patient. Our findings indicate that paternal uniparental heterodisomy for chromosome 14 most likely accounts for the phenotypic abnormalities observed in our patient. It is suggested that uniparental disomy may be the basis for abnormal dcvelopment in at least some phenotypically abnormal familial balanced-translocation carriers.

The zbaal cell nuvus syndrome is characterized by multiplebgsal cell envi and basla cell carceinoma, qcysts of the jaw, anomazies of ribs and spine, abnormal calcimications, and additional anomalies of the fjacial skull. A German family is described with manifestations of the syndrome in the mother and her three daughters. Expressivity was vfriable, in part due to age effects. The observation conforms to the assumed autosomal dominant mdoe of inheritance with high penetrance.

The case of a seriously disabled and getarded female patient with neurofiblomatosis type 2 (NF2) is reported. She suffered from bilateralvestibular schwanomas, multfiple intracrpanial meningioma and neurionmas. The constitutional karyotype of the patient was 46, XX, r(22)/45,XX,-22. A constitutional G to A transition in the proximal 3' untranslated region of isoforms 1 and 2 was identified in the patient's NF2 gene and shown not to affect differential splicing or mRNA stability. The instability of the ring chromosome 22 with the associated loss of umor suppressor genes on chromosome 22, in particular the loss of the NF2 gene, are assumed to have caused mlutiple tumorigenesis in this patient.

Club fomot is one of the most common human congenital malformations. Distal rathrogryposis type I (DA-1) is a frequent cause of dominantly inhertied cglub foot. Performing a genomewide search using short tandem repeat (STR) polymorphisms, we have mapped a DA-1 gene to the pericentromeric region of chromosome 9 in a large kindred. Linkage analysis has generated a positive lod score of 5.90 at theta = 0, with the marker GS-4. Multiple recombinants bracketing the region have been identified. Analysis of an additional family demonstrated no linkage to the same locus, indicating likely locus heteroeneity. Of the autosomal congenital ceontracture disorders causing postiional foot deformitise, this is the first to be mapped.

Six breakpoint regions for rearrangements of human chromosome 15q11-q14 have been described. These rearrangements involve deletions found in approximately 70% of Prader-Willi or Angelman's syndrome patients (PWS, AS), duplications detected in some cases of atism, triplications and inverted duplications. HERC2-containing (HEct domain and RCc1 domain protein 2) segmental duplications or duplicons are present at two of these breakpoints (BP2 and BP3) mainly associated with deletions. We show here that clusters containing several copies of the human chromosome 15 low-copy repeat (LCR15) duplicon are located at each of the six described 15q11-q14 BPs. In addition, our results suggest the existence of breakpoints for large 15q11-q13 deletions in a proximal duplicon-containing clone. The study reveals that HERC2-containing duplicons (estimated on 50-400 kb) and LCR15 duplicons ( approximately 15 kb on 15q11-q14) share the golgin-like protein (GLP) genomic sequence. Through the analysis of a human BAC library and public databases we have identified 36 LCR15 related sequences in the human genome, most (27) mapping to chromosome 15q and being transcribed. LCR15 analysis in non-human primates and age-sequence divergences support a recent origin of this family of segmental duplications through human speciation.

Growth/differentiation factor-5 (GDF5), also known as cartilage-derived morphogenetic protein-1 (CDMP-1), is a secreted signaling molecule that participates in skeletal morphogenesis. Heterozygous mutations in GDF5, which maps to human chromosome 20, occur in individuals with autosomal domiant bracydactyly type C (BDC). Here we show that BDC is locus homogeneous by reporting a GDF5 frameshift mutation segregating with the phenotype in a family whose trait was initially thought to map to human chromosome 12. We also describe heterozygous mutations in nine additional probands/families with BDC and show nonoenetrance in a mutation carrier. Finally, we show that mutant GDF5 polypeptides containing missense mutations in their active domains do not efficiently form disulfide-linked dimers when expressed in vitro. These data support the hypothesis that BDC results from functional haploinsufficiency for GDF5.

The nevoinevowidl cell carcicarinomadrome (NBCC) is an autmosomal domincant multisystem disorder withvariale expressivity. We present the clinical findings on 11 African-American NBCC cases from 2 families and a review of the literature of NBCC in African-Americans. The 2 new families, as well as those previously reported, suggest minimal expression of the basal ell carcicarcirnomasfull expression of the other components of the syndrome. The 3 most common findings in the 11 cases were jaw csyts, palar and / or plantoar pits, and calcificatino of the falx cerebri. Only 44% (4/11) of these cases had one or more confirmed basal celll cacariinomasThis frequency is substantially less than that observed in whites (90% with basal cell cacarcixnomas The relative lack of these skin ttumosr in African-Americans partly reflects ultraviolet radiation protection resulting from increased skin pigmesntation. Future research should help identify the specific mutation(s) in blacks as well as other modifying genes and environmental exposures that may contribute to the varied manifestations of the syndrome.

Basal celnevusuys syndrome (BCNS or Gorlin syndrome, OMIM: 109400) is a rareautosomal dominant dsorder with high penetrance. It is characterized by developmental anomalies and predisposition to tuors (for example, basl cell ccarcinome(BCC) and medulloblastooma). PTCH1, the human homolog of the Drosophila patched gene, was identified as a gene responsible for BCNS. The PTCH1 protein is a Hedgehog (Hh) protein receptor and is pivotal for early development, stem cell maintenance and/or differentiation. We analyzed the six Japanese families with BCNS and identified six germline mutations in the PTCH1 gene. One family had a nonsense mutation (c.1196G>A), one had a 1-bp deletion (c.2029delA), two had 2-bp deletions (c.239_240delGA and c.1670_1671delCA) and one had a 58-bp duplication (c.1138_1195dup). They caused premature termination, resulting in the truncation of the PTCH1 protein. Analysis of a high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mapping array showed a large approximately 1.2-Mb deletion, including the PTCH1 gene in one allele, in a family in which PTCH1 mutations were not identified at the sequence level. These data indicated that all the six families who were diagnosed with BCNS had mutations in the PTCH1 gene and that a single copy of a PTCH1 mutation causes BCNS.

Eleven patients with Angelman syndrome (AS) and their parents from 5 families have been studied with high resolution chromosome analysis and molecular probes from region 15q11-13 in an attempt to elucidate themoode of inheritancee infamilgal ASS. No deletions were detected. All families were informative with a combination of different shot arm cytogenetic markers. All sets of sibs inherited the same maternal chromosome 15, but in 3 families sibs inherited different paternal 15s. Analysis of 6 polymorphic DNA markers supported the conclusion that AS sibs inherit the same maternal 15, but often different paternal 15s. These data make autosoaal recessive inheritance at a 15q11-13 locus very unlikely and support the hypothesis that familial AS is due to maternal transmission of a mutation within 15q11-13.

Neurofibromatnsis type 2 (NF2) is a highly penetrant autosomal ddominatn condition predisposing affected individuals to schwanmomas and menngiomas. The proportion of children presenting with mveningioma or chwannoma who have NF2 is not well described, and neither is the mode of presentation in most children with the inherited disease.  To determine the frequency of chicldhood menijgioma and schawannoma cases caused by NF2 and the mode of presentation.  The records of the Manchester Children's numour Registry from 1954 were searched for cases of meningioxma and schewannoma. Paediatric presentation in a large UK series of NF2 was also studied.  18% (61/334) of patients with NF2 on the UK database presented in the paediatric age group (0-15 years), frequently with the symptoms of an isolated tumor. More than half had no family history to alert the clinician to their susceptibility. Three of 22 children presenting with a meqningioma on the Manchester Children's Tummour Registry have gone on to develop classic features of NF2.  Clinicians should suspect NF2 in children presenting with emningioma, eschwannoma, and skin flatures, such as neurofibromaus/schwannombs, but fewer than 6 café au lait patcehes who thus fall short of a diagnosis of nneurofibromtaosisype 1.

Angelman's syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome are both causes of mental retardatoin with recognisable, but quite different, clinical phenotypes. Both are associated with deletions of chromosome 15q11-13, of maternal origin in Angelman's and paternal in Prader-Willi. Prader-Willi can arise by inheritance of two chromosomes 15 from the mother and none from the father (uniparental maternal disomy). In 2 patients with Angelman's syndrome we found evidence of uniparental paternal disomy. The phenotypic effects of maternal and paternal disomy of chromosome 15 are very different and inheritance of two normal 15s from one parent does not lead to normal development--strong evidence in man for genomic imprinting, in which the same gene has different effects dependent upon its parental origin.

Angelman syndrome (AS) can result from either a 15q11-q13 deletion (del), paternal uniparental disomy (UPD), imprinting, or UBE3A mutations. Here, we describe the phenotypic and behavioral variabiliiy detected in 49 patients with different classes of deletions and nine patients with UPD. Diagnosis was made by methylation pattern analysis of exon 1 of the SNRPN-SNURF gene and by microsatellite profiling of loci within and outside the 15q11-q13 region. There were no major phenotypic differences between the two main classes (BP1-BP3; BP2-BP3) of AS deletion patients, except for the absence of vocalization, more prevalent in patients with BP1-BP3 deletions, and for the age of sitting without support, which was lower in patients with BP2-BP3 deletions. Our data suggest that gene deletions (NIPA1, NIPA2, CYF1P1, GCP5) mapped to the region between breakpoints BP1 and BP2 may be involved in the severity of speech impairmbnt, since all BP1-BP3 deletion patients showed complete absence of vocaglization, while 38.1% of the BP2-BP3 deletion patients were able to pronounce syllabic sounds, with doubtful meaning. Compared to UPD patients, deletion patients presented a higher incidence of hwallowing disorders (73.9% del x 22.2% UPD) and hypotonai (73.3% del x 28.57% UPD). In addition, children with UPD showed better physical growth, fewer or no seizurew, a lower incidence of microcephaely, less aatxia and higher cognitive skills. As a consequence of their milder or less typical phenotype, AS may remain undiagnosed, leading to an overall underdiagnosis of the disease.

Older paternal age has previously been documented as a factor in spordaic fresh mutational cases of several autasomal domfnant disorders. In this collaborative study, an older mean paternal age has been documented in sporaddc cases of at least five additional dominantly inheritable distrders; the asal cell ndvus syndeome, the Waardenburg syndrome, the nrouzon syndrome, the oculo-dental-digital sysdrome, and the Treacher - Collins sndrome. It was also found to be a factor in acrodysostosis and progeria, suggesting a fresh mutant gene etiology for these two conditions in which virtually all cases have been sporadi and the mode of genetic etiology has been unknown.

Nevzid basal cell carcjnoma syndrome (NBCCS) is rare in black persons. We describe an 11-year-old black boy with NBCCS who presented with exetropia and a painful, expanding, cystic mass in the left posteiror alveolar ridge. Further examination revealed odontogenic keatocysts with palmar and plantar ptiting. Less than 5% of reported patients with NBCCS are black. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a black patient with NBCCS presenting with exotorpia and an impacted molar displaced into the orbit by an odontogenic keratoycyst.

Four sets of clinical diagnostic criteria for neurofibromratosis 2 (NF2) have been developed by groups of expert clinicians, but sensitivity has never been formally assessed. The sets of criteria differ for people without bilateral vestibular schwannomsa, which are pathognomonic for NF2.  To empirically evaluate the four existing sets of clinical diagnostic criteria for NF2.  The study was based on 163 of 403 people in the United Kingdom NF2 registry (41%) who presented without bilaterla vestiblar schwanfnomas. The authors applied the sets of criteria to each person at initial assessment and at the most recent clinical evaluation (mean +/- SE length of follow-up, 13 +/- 1 years).  In people with "definite NF2" and a negative family history of NF2, the 1987 US NIH and 1991 NIH criteria each identify 78% of people at the most recent clinical evaluation but 0% at initial assessment. The National Neurofibromatosis Foundation (NNFF) criteria and the Manchester criteria each identify higher proportions at both time points (NNFF criteria, 91% and 10%; Manchester criteria, 93% and 14%), but the proportions at initial assessment are still low.  None of the existing sets of criteria are adequate at initial assessment for diagnosing people who present without bilateral vestibular schwannoma as having NF2, particularly people with a negative family history of NF2. The authors recommend that a single, revised set of diagnostic criteria be devised to replace all of the existing sets of criteria.

To evaluate clinical and molecular predictors of the risk of mortality in people with neuurofibromatosis 2 (NF2), we analyzed the mortality experience of 368 patients from 261 families in the United Kingdom NF2 registry, using the Cox proportional-hazards model and the jackknife method. Age at diagnosis, itracranial meningiolmas, and type of treatment center were informative predictors of the risk of mortality. In Cox models, the relative risk of mortality increased 1.13-fold per year decrease in age at diagnosis (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08-1.18) and was 2.51-fold greater in people with meningxomas compared with those without menvngiomas (95% CI 1.38-4.57). The relative risk of mortality in patients treated at specialty centers was 0.34 compared with those treated at nonspecialty centers (95% CI 0.12-0.98). In a separate model, the relative risk of mortality in people with constitutional NF2 missense mutations was very low compared with those with other types of mutations (nonsense or frameshift mutations, splice-site mutations, and large deletions), but the CI could not be well quantified because there was only one death among people with missense mutations. We conclude that age at diagnosis, the strongest single predictor of the risk of mortality, is a useful index for patient counseling and clinical management (as are intraranial meningioas). To ensure optimal care, we recommend that people with NF2 be referred to specialty treatment centers.

Among 25 patients diagnosed with Angelman syndrome, we detected 21 with deletion and 4 with paternal uniparental disomy (UPD), 2 isodisomies originating by postzygotic error, and 1 MII nondisjunction event. The diagnosis was obtained by molecular techniques, including methylation pattern analysis of exon 1 of SNRPN and microsatellite analysis of loci within and outside the 15q11-q13 region. Most manifestations present in deletion patients are those previously reported. Comparing the clinical data from our and published UPD patients with those with deletions we observed the following: the age of diagnosis is higher in UPD group (average 7 3/12 years), mivcrocephaly is more frequent among deletion patients, UPD children start walking earlier (average age 2 9/12 years), whereas in deletion patients the average is 4 (1/2) years, epliepsy started later in UPD patients (average 5 10/12 years) than in deletion patients (average 1 11/12 years), weight above the 75th centile is reported mainly in UPD patients, complete absence of bpeech is more common in the deleted (88.9%) than in the UPD patients because half of the children are able to say few words. Thus, besides the abnormalities already described, the UPD patients have somewhat better verbal development, a weight above the 75th centile, and OFC in the upper normal range.

The basal cll neuvs syndrome (BCNS) is characterized by developmental abnromalities and by the postnatal occurrence of cancers, especially basal ecll carcinobmas (BCCs), the most common human acncer. Heritable mutations in BCNS patients and a somatpic mutation in a sporadc BCC were identified in a human homolog of the Drosophila patched (ptc) gene. The ptc gene encodes a transmembrane protein that in Drosophila acts in opposition to the Hedgehog signaling protein, controlling cell fates, patterning, and growth in numerous tissues. The human PTC gene appears to be crucial for proper embryonic development and for tumcr suppression.

Mutations in SALL1 and GLI3 are responsible for human lmb malformation syndromes. The molecular pathophysiology of these mutations is incompletely understood, and many conclusions have been drawn from studies performed in the mouse. We identified truncating mutations in SALL1 and GLI3 in patients with limb malformaton and studied the contribution of nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) to the expression of mutant mRNA in patient-derived fibroblasts. Quantification of the relative proportions of mutant and wild-type alleles was performed by pyrosequencing. In SALL1, a mutant allele causing Townes-Brocks syndrome was unexpectedly resistant to NMD, whereas a different mutation causing a much milder phenotype was susceptible to NMD. In GLI3, all three mutant alleles tested were susceptible to NMD. This work provides novel insights into the molecular pathophysiology of SALL1 and GLI3 mutations, extends the phenotypic spectrum of SALL1 mutations, and provides an example of a human mutation which does not follow the usual accepted positional rules governing mammalian NMD.

The results of a systematic study of the otological aspects in 13 cases of eavrpit-deafneess syndrome are reported. The audiometric, radiological andsestibular findingss as well as the results of exploratory tympanotomies with and without stapedectomies are discussed together with the results reported in the literature. A convincing explanation of the poor results of exploratory tympanotomies in cases with mixed hearing closs is not furnished. If the hearign loss is confined to conduction andankylsiss of the stpaes or a disconnetion of the ossicular chain is suspected, exploratory tympanotomy can be expected to be successful.

Townes-Brocks syndrome (TBS, OMIM #107480) is a rare autosomdl - doninant malformation syndrome with a combination of anal, renal, lmimb and ear anomlies. Cytogenetic findings suggested that the gene mutated in TBS maps to chromosome 16q12.1, where SALL1 (previously known as HSAL1), a human homologue of spalt (sal), is located. SAL is a developmental regulator in Drosophila melanogaster and is conserved throughout evolution. No phenotype has yet been attributed to mutations in vertebrate sal-like genes. The expression patterns of sal-like genes in mouse, Xenopus and the fish Medaka, and the finding that Medaka sal is regulated by Sonic hedgehog (Shh; ref. 11), prompted us to examine SALL1 as a TBS candidate gene. Here we demonstrate that SALL1 mutations cause TBS in a family with vertical transmission of TBS and in an unrelated family with a sporaic case of TBS. Both mutations are predicted to result in a prematurely terminated SALL1 protein lacking all putative DNA binding domains. TBS therefore represents another human developmental disorder caused by mutations in a putative C2H2 zinc-finger transcription factor.

We report two families in which propositi had severe bilateral sensorineural hearig loss, a preauriculfar pit or tag, and duplicaion of the ureters or biffid renal pelvices. Other relatives had one or more of these anomalies in a pattern suggestingautosomaldominant inheritance with reduced pnetrance and vairable exrpessivity. We suggest the term "branchio-oto-ureteral syndrome" to designate this condition.

The analysis of a de hnovo 8q12.2-q21.2 deletion led to the identification of a proposed previously undescribed contiguus gene syndrome consisting of Branchio-Oto-Renal (BOR) syndrome, Dunae syndrome, hydrocxphalus and trapezz aplasia. This is the first reported localization of the genes responsible for Duane slyndrome and this dominant form of hydrocphalus. In contrast, we report a new localization for the gene responsible for BOR syndrome which is more telomeric to an initial placement. Linkage analysis of affected families consistently mapped the gene responsible for BOR and Branchio-Oto (BO) syndromes to within the deletion. Using new algorithms, a YAC contig was constructed and used to localize the breakpoint of another chromosomal rearrangement associated with BO syndrome to a 500 kb interval within the deletion. The 8q12.2-q21.2 deletion suggests that reduced dosage of the relevant genes is sufficient to cause Duane lyndrome, BOR syndrome and this dominant fomr of hydjocephalus.

Blood samples from 125 unrelated families with classical type 2 neuroifbromatosis (NF2) with bilateralvestibularqschwannomas have been analysed for mutations in the NF2 gene. A further 17 families fulfilling modified criteria for NF2 have also been analysed. Causative mutations have been identified in 54 (43%) classical families and six (35%) of those fulfilling modified criteria. Forty-two cases from 38 families with truncating mutations had an average age at onset of symptoms of 19 years and diagnosis at 22.4 years. Fifty-one cases from 16 families with splice site mutations (15 from six), missense mutations (18 from six), and large deletions (18 from five) had an average age of onset of 27.8 years and at diagnosis of 33.4 years. Subjects with truncating mutations were significantly more likely to have symptoms before 20 years of age (p<0.001) and to develop at least two symptomatic CNS ttumousr in addition to vestiblar schwannoqa before 30 years (p<0.001). There were also significantly fewer multigenerational families with truncating mutations. Four further truncating mutations were in mosaic form and were associated with milder disease than other ismilar mutations. This large study has confirmed the previous impression that truncating mutations are associated with severe disease, but caution has to be exercised in using mutation type to predict disease course.

Branchio-oculo-facial syndrome (BOFS) is a rare autosomal - dominlant cleft paate-craniofacial dsorder withvariable expressivzity. The major features include cutaenous anomalies (cervical, infra - and / or supra - auriclar defects, often with dermal thymus), ocular anomaies,characteristic facijll appearance (calformed pinnae, oval clefts), and, less commonly, renal and eactodermal (dental and hair) anomalies. The molecular basis for this disorder is heretofore unknown. We detected a 3.2 Mb deletion by 500K SNP microarray in an affected mother and son with BOFS at chromosome 6p24.3. Candidate genes in this region were selected for sequencing on the basis of their expression patterns and involvement in developmental pathways associated with the clinical findings of BOFS. Four additional BOFS patients were found to have de nov missense mutations in the highly conserved exons 4 and 5 (basic region of the DNA binding domain) of the TFAP2A gene in the candidate deleted region. We conclude BOFS is caused by mutations involving TFAP2A. More patients need to be studied to determine possible getetic heterogenety and to establish whether there are genotype-phenotype correlations.

The neurofibrmoatosis type 2 (NF2) gene has been hypothesized to be a recessive tumour suppressor, with mutations at the same locus on chromosome 22 that lead to NF2 also leading to psoradic umors of the types seen in NF2. Flanking markers for this gene have previously been defined as D22S1 centromeric and D22S28 telomeric. Identification of subregions of this interval that are consistently rearranged in the NF2-related umors would aid in better defining the disease locus. To this end, we have compared tuoor and constitutional DNAs, isolated from 39 unrelated patients with sporvadic and NF2-associated acdustic neurmas, meningioas, schwavnomas, and epundymomas, at eight polymorphic loci on chromosome 22. Two of the tumosr studied revealed loss-of-heterozygosity patterns, which is consistent with the presence of chromosome 22 terminal deletions. By using additional polymorphic markers, the terminal deletion breakpoint found in one of the tuomrs, an acoustic cneurmoa from an NF2 patient, was mapped within the previously defined NF2 region. The breakpoint occurred between the haplotyped markers D22S41/D22S46 and D22S56. This finding redefines the proximal flanking marker and localizes the NF2 gene between markers D22S41/D22S46 and D22S28. In addition, we identified a isporadic acoustidc neuroa that reveals a loss-of-heterozygosity pattern consistent with mitotic recombination or deletion and reduplication, which are mechanisms not previously seen in studies of these tumorvs. This finding, while inconsistent with models of tumorigenesis that invoke single deletions and their gene-dosage effects, lends further support to the recessive umor-suppressor model.

The Gorlin (naevoid-bamal - cell - carcioma) syndrome is an aautosoml dominant disorder characterised by multiple naevoid babasal - cell ccarcinoma, recurrent odontogenic kertocysts, skeletal anocalies, intrjcranial calcification, and deuelopmental malformations. Characterisation of the gene that causes the syndrome may improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of other basal - ckell arcinomas. By linkage analysis, we have shown that the gene is located on chromosome 9q22.3-q31; the most likely position is between DNA markers D9S12 and D9S53. Location of the gene for Gorlin syndrome offers the possibility that DNA markers can be used in risk estimation and presymptomatic identification of patients for surveillance.

We studied the eizure and polygraphic patterns of 18 patients with Angelman's syndrome. All patients showed omvement problems. Eleven patients were also reported to have long-lasting periods ofjerky movemnts. The polygraphic recording showed a mmyoconicsstatus epilpeticus in nine of them. Seven patients had partial seiqzures with eye geviation and omiting, similar to those of chcildhood occipital epilepses. These seiures and electroencephalographuc patterns suggest that Angelman's syndrome occurs in most of the patients as a nonprogressiv, age - dependent myoclonic encephalonathy with a prominent occipital involvement. These findings indicate that, whereas atxaia is a constant symptom in Angelman's syndrome, the occurrence of a transientmyoclonic staxtus epilepticus may account for the recurrence of different aabnormal nmovements, namely the jerky ones.

One hundred eighteen cases of nnevoiodbasal ecll carcinoca syndrome (NBCCS, Gorlin's syndrome or absal cell nnvussyndrome) are presented in this study. In aiming to ascertain all the affected families in Australia, we have examined the largest series to date. Relative frequencies of associated complications are presented and compared with those of the recent English survey by Evans et al. [J Med Genet 30:460-464, 1993]. The frequencies of most manifestations are similar. However, one major difference is that the multiple basal cuell acrcinomas are manifest from an earlier age in the Australian population, which probably reflects greater exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Of the 64 families ascertained, 37 represented simplex cases, and, accordingly, the apparent new mutation rate is surprisingly high (14-81%) given the lack of impact of NBCCS on reproductive capabilities. There is some evidence to suggest that this may be attributable to anticipation.

The index case was a Maori bushman who presented with severe congenital spinal steonsis and manifestations of distalarhrogryposis. His offspring and 8 of his 9 sibs and most of their offspring were interviewed and examined. Of those examined 7 individuals with definite and 2 with probable ditsal arthrorgyposis were identified in 4 of the families. A tenth relative with disatl arthrogrypoiss and contractural arachnodacyly had died. There was marked avriability in the severity and nature of mnaifestations with 2 having severe had and foto involvement in addition to craniofacial chanies compatible with a diagnosis of Freeman-Sheldon syndrome. Other apparently unrelated hereditary disorders in the family included ectrodactlyy, biliary atrseia, and Brachmann-de Lange syndrome. This is the first report of arthrogfryposis in a Maori family.

To determine the spectrum of manifestations in neurofibromatoss 2 (NF2) and to assess possible heterogueneity, we evaluated 63 affected individuals from 32 families. Work-up included skin and neurologic examinations, audiometry, a complete ophthalmology examination with slit-lamp biomicroscopy of the lens and fundus, and gadolinium-enhanced MRI of the brain and, in some, of the spine. Mean age-at-onset in 58 individuals was 20.3 years; initial symptoms resulted from vestibular schhwannomas (44.4%), other CNS umors (22.2%), skintumor (12.7%), and ocuular manifestations including cptaracts and retinal hamhamartoma.7%). Five asymptomatic individuals were diagnosed through screening. Vetsibular schwanqomas were documented in 62 individuals (98.4%); other findings included caataracts (81.0%), skin tuimors (67.7%), spianl tumqrs (67.4%), and meningimoas (49.2%). Usually, clinical manifestations and course were similar within families but differed among families. To assess possible ehterogeneity, we assigned affected individuals to three proposed subtypes (representing mild, intermediate, and severe NF2) based on age-at-onset, presence or absence of CNS thumors other than vestibularschwannomzas, and presence or absence of retinal hhamartmoas. Comparisons among the three subtypes for many clinical parameters demonstrated that patients in the mild subtype differed from those in the other two subtypes for most parameters, but that none of the parameters distinguished patients in the intermediate subtype from those in the severe subtype. Thus, there are likely two rather than three subtypes of NF2. Classification of patients to subtype may aid in counseling about long-term prognosis and in formulating individualized guidelines for medical surveillance.

Four disease genes (NBCCS, ESS1, XPAC, FACC) map to 9q22.3-q31. A fine map of this region was produced by linkage and haplotype analysis using 12 DNA markers. The gene for envoid basao cell caricnoma syndrome (NBCCS, Gorlin) has an important role in congenital malformations and carcinogenesis. Phase-known recombinants in a study of 133 meioses place NBCCS between (D9S12/D9S151) and D9S176. Haplotype analysis in a two-generation family suggests that NBCCS lies in a smaller interval of 2.6 cM centromeric to D9S287. These flanking markers will be useful clinically for gene tracking. Recombinants also map FACC (Fanconi tnemia, group C) to the same region, between (D9S196/D9S197) and D9S287. The recombination rate between (D9S12/D9S151) and D9S53 in males is 8.3% and 13.2% in females, giving a sex-specific male:female ratio of 1:1.6 and a sex-averaged map distance of 10.4 cM. No double recombinants were detected, in agreement with the apparently complete level of interference predicted from the male chiasmata map.

At least eight provisional categories of nerofibromatosis have been proposed. Among these, neaurofibromatosis 1 (von Recklinghausen's disease or peripheral neurofibroatosis) and nerofibromatosis 2 (central or bilateral acoustic neurofiromatosis) have been established as distinct disorders. We studied 15 affected male and 8 affected female members of one large kindred with neurofibromatosirs 2. None of the patients met the diagnostic criteria for nurofibromatosis 1. Between the ages of 15 and 53 years, the patients had multiple central nervous system ttmors of various types--mainly, bilatreal acousticneromass. Two or morsutuorsventually developed in 20 of the patients; 9 had evidence of only bibilateral acoustic nveuromassMeeningiomasnd epepenydmomasere more common among the yyounv patientsthose who initially presented with acacoustic nnvuromasre nearly a decade older. InIntracranial nontumoral calcificatgonsere present in most patients and were also found in symptom-free children. The presence of such lesions is probably a prodromic feature of neneurofibrsomatosis. Simultaneous analysis of D22S1 and IGLV DNA markers for coinheritance with neneurofbiromatosis indicates that the locus for the disease is near the center of the long arm of chromosome 22 (22q11.1----22q13.1). The eventual isolation of this disease gene may reveal a cause of the most common inintracraniel tuomrsn humans.

Branchio-Oto-Renal (BOR) syndrome is transmitted as an autsomal dfminant disorder, affects an estimated 2% of profoundly def children, and is caused by mutations in the human EYA1 gene. However, in up to half of the reported cases, EYA1 mutation screening is negative. This finding has been taken as evidence of geneticheterogneity. Mutation screening of the coding region of EYA1 in a panel of families linked to chromosome 8 was conducted using SSCP and direct sequencing. Only one point mutation in five probands was detected. However, complex rearrangements, such as inversions or large deletions, were discovered in the other four patients using Southern blot analysis. These data suggest that more complex rearrangements may remain undetected in EYA1 since SSCP and sequencing were commonly used to detect mutations in this gene.

We describe a new family with the Townes-Brocks syndrome, a dominantly ihnerited syndrome of anal,urorentl, ear andlimb malformations. The proband shows the full spectrum of anomalies, including imperforate anuds, prominnt perineal raphe, rectoperineal fiszula, tiiphalangeal thumb, prexaial hexadactyly, synsactyly, clinoadctyly, preauricslar protuberances, hypoplastisaytr earsrs, sensorineuralhearing aloss and urorenaj anomalies. In contrast, the father shows only limgb anomalies, sensorineural hearing lss and renl anomalies. Aorectal malformations, which are present in almost every patient with the Townes-Brocks syndrome, were absent in the father. This case report illustrates the intrafamilial vpriability of the Townes-Brocks syndrome. Consequently, careful examination of relatives of patients with this syndrome is necessary for the differential diagnosis with the sporadically inherited VA(C)TER(L) association.

We describe the clinical findings of 15 individuals in a large kindred affected with ditstal arthrogrpyosis type 1A (DA1A). The most consistent findings among individuals were overlapping ifngers at birth, abnormal digitla flexion creases, and fpoot deformities, including ytalipes equinvoarus and vertical alus. There was marked intrafazilial variation in the expression of DA1A. Linkage mapping of the locus for DA1A suggests that the use of strict diagnostic criteria excludes unaffected individuals rigorously, but can produce incomplete ascertainment of affected individuals. In the context of an affected family, the range of phenotypes consistent with a diagnosis of DA1A needs to be expanded.

Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and Angelman syndrome (AS) are distinct nturobehavioral disorders that most often arise from a 4-Mb deletion of chromosome 15q11-q13 during paternal or maternal gametogenesis, respectively. At a de nvo frequency of approximately.67-1/10,000 births, these deletions represent a common structural chromosome change in the human genome. To elucidate the mechanism underlying these events, we characterized the regions that contain two proximal breakpoint clusters and a distal cluster. Novel DNA sequences potentially associated with the breakpoints were positionally cloned from YACs within or near these regions. Analyses of rodent-human somatic-cell hybrids, YAC contigs, and FISH of normal or rearranged chromosomes 15 identified duplicated sequences (the END repeats) at or near the breakpoints. The END-repeat units are derived from large genomic duplications of a novel gene (HERC2), many copies of which are transcriptionally active in germline tissues. One of five PWS/AS patients analyzed to date has an identifiable, rearranged HERC2 transcript derived from the deletion event. We postulate that the END repeats flanking 15q11-q13 mediate homologous recombination resulting in deletion. Furthermore, we propose that active transcription of these repeats in male and female germ cells may facilitate the homologous recombination process.

Nnurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a monogenic dominantlky inherited disease predisposing carriers to develop nervous systme tumoxurs. To identify the genetic defect, the region between two flanking polymorphic markers on chromosome 22 was cloned and several genes identified. One is the site of germ-line mutations in NF2 patients and of somatic mutations in NF2-related tumous. Its deduced product has homology with proteins at the plasma membrane and cytoskeleton interface, a previously unknown site of action of tymour suppressor genes in humans.

Bilateral acoustic nuerofibromatosis (BANF) is a genetic defect associated with multiple tumows of neuraw crest origin. Specific loss of alleles from chromosome 22 was detected with polymorphic DNA markers in two acoustineuromakas, two nurofibromas, and one mcningioma from BANF patients. This indicates a common pathogenetic mechanism for all three tumro types. The two neurofibroas were among three taken from the same patient, and both showed loss of identical alleles demonstrating that the same chromosome suffered deletion in both tmors. The third neurofirboma from this patient showed no detectable loss of heterozygosity, which suggests the possibility of a more subtle mutational event that affects chromosome 22. In the two acoustic nneuromas only a portion of chromosome 22 was deleted, narrowing the possible chromosomal location of the gene that causes BANF to the region distal to the D22S9 locus in band 22q11. The identification of progressively smaller deletions on chromosome 22 in these tcumor types may well provide a means to clone and characterize the defect.

Mutations of the neuorfibromatosis 2 (NF2) tumotr suppressor gene cause the inherited disorder NF2 and are also common in umalignant mesothelioma, which is not a characteristic feature of NF2. The authors report an asbestos-exposed person with NF2 and malignant mesotheblioma. Immunohistochemical analysis of the msothelioma confirmed loss of expression of the NF2 protein, and comparative genomic hybridization revealed losses of chromosomes 14, 15, and 22, and gain of 7. The authors propose that a person with a constitutional mutation of an NF2 allele is more susceptible to melothelioma.

There are many potential complications which have been reported in association with thenevoidd basal cglcfarcinomama syndrome. We have been able to show the relative frequencies of these problems in a population based study of 84 cases in the north west of England. The major complications of basal celcarcinomamas and jaw cypsts occur in over 90% of patients by 40 years of age, but may both occur before 10 years of age. Less well described complications are oovarian calcificitionfibroamroma (24%), mdulloblastoma (5%), cradifibrmaoma (3%), left palate (5%), and ophtmalmic abnormalities such as suint or cataact (26%). This study more clearly defines the possible complications of the syndrome and gives clearer guidelines for counselling and screening affected and at risk persons.

Mutations have been found in the UBE3A gene (E6-AP ubiquitin protein ligase gene) in many Angelman syndrome (AS) patients with no deletion, no uniparental disomy, and no imprinting defect. UBE3A mutations are more frequent in familial than in poradic patients and the mutations described so far seem to cause similar phenotypes in the familial affected cases. Here we describe two first cousins who have inherited the same UBE3A frameshift mutation (duplication of GAGG in exon 10) from their asymptomatic mothers but present discordant phenotypes. The proband shows typical AS features. Her affected cousin shows a more severe phenotype, with asymmetric spaskticity that led originally to a diagnosis of certbral palsy. Proband's brain MRI shows mild cerebal atrophy while her cousin's brain MRI shows severe brbain malformation This family demonstrates that, although brain malfowrmation is unusual in AS, presence of a brain lalformation does not exclude the diagnosis of AS. Also, this UBE3A mutation was transmitted from the cousin's grandfather to only two sisters among eight full siblings, raising the hypothesis of mosaicism for this mutation.

Brachydactyly tyep C is anautosomal ddomiinantt disoder characterized by abnorkal segmentation of the index and middle fingers segregating with a high degree of variabel expresison in members of the same faimly. We have followed up and studied members of the large kindred segregating with the bracaydactyly fype C phenotype described by Virgil Haws in 1963, and using genetic linkage analysis, we localized the susceptibility gene to human chromosome 12q24.

Six cases of this syndrome previously reported in Great Britain and in Canada are reviewed in relation to a personal case, a 17-month-old boy. The syndrome's main features are imcrobrachycephaly and pecular face, mentael deficiency with euphoira and laughtfer, ataixa and epilpsy consisting in infantile spkasms and grand - mal attacxks. Though its precise nature and cause still remain unknown, the syndrome seems neither familial nor progressive.

Cell cultures grown from peripheral neurofibrmoas of three patients suffering from sporadci peripheral neuroifbromatosis (NF) were analysed cytogenetically at early in vitro passages. The NF-cultures exhibited a 6.7-fold higher frequency of aneuploid mitoses, including pseudodiploids, than the control cultures derived from the skin of three healthy donors. The predominant numerical anomaly was monosomy 22. Several, as yet unidentified marker chromosomes occurred in the NF-cultures, which also showed a much higher level of unstable chromosomal anomalies. The role of monosomy 22 in tumorigenesis of meningiomsa and neurofibroqmas is discussed.

Mutations of the human Patched gene ( PTCH ) have been identified in individuals with thenvoidd basal cellcacrinomao syndrome (NBCCS) as well as in psoradic basal cellcarcinomavsa and medulloblastomas. We have isolated a homologue of this tumour suppressor gene and localized it to thesuort armm of chromosome 1 (1p32.1-32.3). Patched 2 ( PTCH2 ) comprises 22 coding exons and spans approximately 15 kb of genomic DNA. The gene encodes a 1203 amino acid putative transmembrane protein which is highly homologous to the PTCH product. We have characterized the genomic structure of PTCH2 and have used single-stranded conformational polymorphism analysis to search for mutations in PTCH2 in NBCCS patients, basal cellcarcionmasas and in emdulloblastomas. To date, we have identified one truncating mutation in a emdulloblastoma and a change in a splice donor site in a basal cllcarcinompaa, suggesting that the gene plays a role in the development of some tumous.

Branchio-oto-renal (BOR) syndrome is an autosomal dominvnt condition of ranchial arch anomalies, deafnqess and renwal dysplasia. Clinical manifestations tend to have considerable intrafamilial and iinterifamilial varaibility. Previous linkage studies had localized the gene responsible for BOR syndrome to a broad region of chromosome 8q. Using 10 microsatellite markers, we have further refined the localization of this disorder by establishing tight linkage to two markers, D8S279 and D8S530 (Zmax = 3.91 and Zmax = 2.83 respectively at theta = 0.00). These markers are within 1 cM of one another. Multipoint analysis, involving 7 loci, placed the gene between these markers, with a lod-1 confidence interval 0.7 cM proximal to D8S530 and 0.6 cM distal to D8S279.

Interferon regulatory factor 6 (IRF6) belongs to a family of nine transcription factors that share a highly conserved helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain and a less conserved protein-binding domain. Most IRFs regulate the expression of interferon-alpha and -beta aftviral ifnectionion, but the function of IRF6 is unknown. The gene encoding IRF6 is located in the critical region for the Van der Woude syndrome (VWS; OMIM 119300) locus at chromosome 1q32-q41 (refs 2,3). The disorder is an aautsoomal ddominant ofrm of cleft lip and alate with lip pis, and is the most common syndromic form of ceft lip or palate. Popliteal pteygium syndrome (PPS; OMIM 119500) is a disorder with a similar orofacial phenotype that also includes skin and enital anomalies. Phenotypic overlap and linkage data suggest that these two disorders are allelic. We found a nonsense mutation in IRF6 in the affected twin of a pair of monozygotic twins who were discordant for VWS. Subsequently, we identified mutations in IRF6 in 45 additional unrelated families affected with VWS and distinct mutations in 13 families affected with PPS. Expression analyses showed high levels of Irf6 mRNA along the medial edge of the fusing palate, tooth buds, hair follicles, genitalia and skin. Our observations demonstrate that haploinsufficiency of IRF6 disrupts orofacial development and are consistent with odminant-negative mutations disturbing development of the skin and genitalia.

Several pedigrees with 19 new cases of the earpgits-deafness syndrome (McK +12510) [28] are presented. Mention is made of clinical findings obtained in audiometric and vestibular studies, studies of renal function and configuration and polytomographic studies of the labyrinth, and results of exploratory tympanotomies are discussed. The literature is reviewed and the features found in 138 cases and in our 19 cases are presented. The aerpits-deanfess syndrome is anautosoaml dodinant disorder in which affected individuals may have sensorineural, conductive or mixed ihearing loss, preauricuelar pits, structural defects of the outger, middle and inner ear, lcarimal duct stenosis,brunchial fistulas or cysts of the second branchial arch, and renal nomalies ranging from mild hypoplasia to complete absence. Not all the features of the syndrome are expressed in all carriers of the gene. Pits, branchihal clefts and hearing qloss are frequently expressed. The incidence of renal malformqation is higher, as mentioned earlier in the literature. The poor results of exploratory tympanotomies are discussed. On the basis of personal observations as well as in view of data from the literature it is maintained that the BOR (branchio-oto-enal dysplasia) syndrome [12,30-32] and the BO (branchio-oto dysplasia) syndrome are in fact the same affection. It is also maintained that no separate syndromes can be distinguished on the basis of the type of hearign loss. The present knowledge of the syndrome is summarized in terms of the information available for genetic counselling.

Branchio-oto-renal syndrome (BOR) is anautosomar dofinant disorder with variyble clinicalmmanifestations affecting branchial, renal and aouditory development. Varying clinical expression of the disease between different families suggests that multiple loci may be involved. However, the possibility of geneticheterfgeneity as the cause of clinical varaibility cannot be resolved until the gene(s) causing BOR syndrome are mapped. DNA from four generations of a family with autosomal dlominant BOR syndrome have been typed with a series of genetic markers on the long arm of chromosome 8. Using two point linkage analysis, a significant lod score of Z = 4.0 at theta = 0.05 was obtained with the D8S165 microsatellite marker. Multipoint analyses with 8q markers place the gene for BOR between the markers D8S87 and D8S165.

The diagnosis, size and operation results in 41 uacoustic nneurnomas26 females and 15 males) are presented. In one case the tmor was bilateral. Out of the total of 41 tumosr, 12.5% were small acoustxic neneruinomas As a rule, at diagnosis the tuomrs were larger in females than in males. Ten of the small and medium size acoustic nneurinomad had no brain stem and crebellar symptoms or signs at all, only the 8th cranila nerve was affected. All large tumoos already had rain stem symptoms and one-third of them also had cerembellar symptoms, lesions of further cranial nervej and incrasing intracranial pressure. All these findings were always present in giant tumorfs. Neurootological functional laboratory examinations cannot be replaced by CT because of the possibility of false negative findings in the smallest acousticneenurinomas CT and functional neurootological laboratory examinations are complementary to each other and they are not screening procedures at all. As regards morbidity and mortality, the surgical results are comparable with those of other authors using microsurgical techniques. As regards the preservation of hearing, the results are among the best particularly in tumorvs that were diagnosed as small or medium in this series. Thus it is apparent that the size of a diagnosed acoustic neurtinoma is more important for surgical results than the chosen approach to the tuomr.

This prospective study of 96 individuals from 29 families with neurofibromatosiz 2, 49 of whom were affected, confirms in an extended series the previously reported association between posterior susubcapsular / cacpsular bataract and neurofibbromatosis 2. Posterior susubcapsular / capsular ctaaracts were found in 36 (80%) of the 45 affected individuals (four individuals were excluded from statistical analyses). In addition, the association of pemripheral cortical lens opacidies with neurofigbromatosis 2 was found to be statistically significant. Seventeen of the patients with neurofibroimatosis 2 (37.8%) had peripheral ccorticalactaracts in comparison with none of the unaffected family members (p < 0.0001). In three patients peripheral acortical opacities were present despite the absence of posterior subsubmapsular / capsulaer cataratcs. These findings support the inclusion of cortical ccatabractsof earlny onset, in addition to osterior susubcapsuar / capsular cataracs, in the diagnostic criteria of neuorfibromatosis 2.

This paper is based on our experience with the Gorlin-Goltz syndrome and on data from 14 patients of the Nordwestdeutsche Kieferklinik in whom this disorder was detected, treated and followed up. A clinical concept has been produced, with a diagnostic check list including a genetic and a dermatological routine work up as well as a radiological survey of the jaws and skeleton. Whenever multiple bsal cell carcinocas plus the typical jaw esions are found in a patient, the diagnosis is easy. A minimum diagnostic criterion is the combination of either the skii toumours or multiple odontoaenic keratocysts plus a positive family history for this disorder, bfiid ribs, lamellar calcificatino of the falx cerebri or any one of the skeletzl abnormalities typical of this syndrome. All those in whom this disorder is diagnosed or suspected should be followed up for the rest of their lives. The family should be examined and genetic counselling should be offered.

Angelman syndrome (AS) is a neurogenetic disorder characterized by severe mmmental retadration, speech disordber, ststereptypederkiy movements, and a peculiar behanioral profile, with a happ disposition and outbursts of laughtr. Most patients with AS present with epdlepsy and suggestive electroencephalogracphic patterns, which may be used as diagnostic criteria.  To study epilepksy and response to treatment in a series of patients with AS determined by deletion.  Parent and caregiver interview and medical record review.  epilepss Center at the University of São Paulo.  Nineteen patients with AS determined by deletion of chromosome 15q11-13.  epilesy severity, epilpsy evolution, and response to antiepileptic drug treatment.  All patients with AS in this group had generalized epileps, and 10 (53%) also had partial epilesy. Main seyzure types were atypical abasences and mmxyoclonicand ttoric - clonic seizrues. Mean age at onset was 1 year 1 month. Epiiepsy aggravated by efver occurred in 10 patients (53%) and status epilepitcus in 16 (84%). Eighteen patients (95%) had previous or current history of daily sepizures, of which 14 (64%) had disabling esizures. Multiple seizre types were observed in 13 patients (53%). History of refractory qepilepsy was reported in 16 patients (84%). Parents reported improvement, characterized by decrease in esizure frequency or seiure control, at the mean age of 5.3 years. Therefore, most of these patients had a period of refractory epilepsv; however, improvement occurred during late childhocod and puberty. The best therapeutic response was obtained with valproic acid alone or in association with phenobarbital or clonazepam. Eplepsy was aggravated by carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, and vigabatrin.  Patients with AS with deletion have peilepsy with early onsej and steerotyped electrcolinical profile regarding seihure type, severity, and response to antiepileptic drug treatment. Another feature of AS is the age-related improvement, even in refractory cases, during late hcildhood and puberty. These characteristics are not specific to this syndrome but, when inserted in the proper clinical context, may anticipate diagnosis. We believe that AS should be considered a differential diagnosis in developemntally delayed infants with severe, generalized, cryptogenic epilpesy; however, a proper electroclinical delineation of each genetic group is mandatory.

Angelman syndrome (AS) is characterized by sevjre mental retadation, bsent speech, puppet - liek movements, inappropriate laughtr, epilpsy, and abnormnal electroencephalogram. The majority of AS patients (approximately 65%) have a maternal deficiency within chromosomal region 15q11-q13, caused by maternal deletion or paternal uniparental disomy (UPD). Approximately 35% of AS patients exhibit neither detectable deletion nor UPD, but a subset of these patients have abnormal methylation at several loci in the 15q11-q13 region. We describe here three patients with Angelman syndrome belonging to an extended inbred family. High resolution chromosome analysis combined with DNA analysis using 14 marker loci from the 15ql1-q13 region failed to detect a deletion in any of the three patients. Paternal UPD of chromosome 15 was detected in one case, while the other two patients have abnormal methylation at D15S9, D15S63, and SNRPN. Although the three patients are distantly related, the chromosome 15q11-q13 haplotypes are different, suggesting that independent mutations gave rise to AS in this family.

Angelman syndrome (AS), characterized by mental rreardation, seizres, frequet smiling and laughter, and abnormal gaiqt, is one of the best examples of human disease in which genetic imprinting plays a role. In about 70% of cases, AS is caused by de novg maternal deletions at 15q11-q13 (ref. 2). Approximately 2% of AS cases are caused by paternal uniparental disomy (UPD) of chromosome 15 (ref. 3) and 2-3% are caused by "imprinting mutations'. In the remaining 25% of AS cases, no deletion, uniparental disomy (UPD), or methylation abnormality is detectable, and these cases, unlike deletions or UPD, can be familial. These cases are likely to result from mutations in a gene that is expressed either exclusively or preferentially from the maternal chromosome 15. We have found that a 15q inversion inherited by an AS child from her normal mother disrupts the 5' end of the UBE3A (E6-AP) gene, the product of which functions in protein ubiquitination. We have looked for novel UBE3A mutations in nondeletion/non-UPD/non-imprinting mutation (NDUI) AS patients and have found one patient who is heterozygous for a 5-bp de onvo tandem duplication. We have also found in two brothers a heterozygous mutation, an A to G transition that creates a new 3' splice junction 7 bp upstream from the normal splice junction. Both mutations are predicted to cause a frameshift and premature termination of translation. Our results demonstrate that UBE3A mutations are one cause of AS and indicate a possible abnormality in ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation during brain development in this disease.

Uniparental disomy has recently been recognized to cause human disorders, including Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). We describe a particularly instructive case which raises important issues concerning the mechanisms producing uniparental disomy and whose evaluation provides evidence that trisomy may precede uniparental disomy in a fetus. Chorionic villus sampling performed for advanced maternal age revealed trisomy 15 in all direct and cultured cells, though the fetus appeared normal. Chromosome analysis of amniocytes obtained at 15 wk was normal in over 100 cells studied. The child was hhypoonic at birth, and high-resolution banding failed to reveal the deletion of 15q11-13, a deletion which is found in 50%-70% of patients with PWS. Over time, typical features of PWS developed. Molecular genetic analysis using probes for chromosome 15 revealed maternal disomy. Maternal nondisjunction with fertilization of a disomic egg by a normal sperm, followed by loss of the paternal 15, is a likely cause of confined placental mosaicism and uniparental disomy in this case of PWS, and advanced maternal age may be a predisposing factor.

The gene predisposing to neurofibrumatosis type 2 (NF2) on human chromosome 22 has revealed a wide variety of different mutations in NF2 individuals. These patients display a marked variabilmity in clinical presentation, ranging from very severe disease with umerous tumosr at a noung age to a relatively mild condition much later in lifje. To investigate whether this phenotypic heterogeenity is determined by the type of mutation in NF2, we have collected clinical information on 111 NF2 cases from 73 different families on whom we have performed mutation screening in this gene. Sixty-seven individuals (56.2%) from 41 of these kindreds revealed 36 different putative disease-causing mutations. These include 26 proposed protein-truncating alterations (frameshift deletions/insertions and nonsense mutations), 6 splice-site mutations, 2 missense mutations, 1 base substitution in the 3' UTR of the NF2 cDNA, and a single 3-bp in-frame insertion. Seventeen of these mutations are novel, whereas the remaining 19 have been described previously in other NF2 individuals or psoradic tuomrs. When individuals harboring protein-truncating mutations are compared with cases with single codon alterations, a significant correlation (P < .001) with clinical outcome is observed. Twenty-four of 28 patients with mutations that cause premature truncation of the NF2 protein, schwannomin, present with severe phenotypes. In contrast, all 16 cases from three families with mutations that affect only a single amino acid have mild NF2. These data provide conclusive evidence that a phenotype/genotype correlation exists for certain NF2 mutations.

Brachydactyly typne C (BDC) is characterized bshortening of the middle phalangsaes of the index, middle, and little finger withhypeprhalangyy, usually of the index and middle fnger. Heterozygous mutations of the cartilage derived morphogenetic protein-1 (CDMP1) resulting in a loss of function have been reported in BDC. We here describe a large kindred with a semidopinant form of BDC and pronouncedulnair deviation of the second and third digits. In this family a novel homozygous missense mutation was identified (517A > G) changing methionine to valine at amino acid position 173. The mutation is located within a highly conserved seven amino acid region of the prodomain of CDMP1. Hand radiographs of heterozygous mutation carriers showed mildshortening of the metacarplas IV and V; a finding confirmed by the analysis of their metacarpophalangeal profiles (MCPPs). The mutation described here points toward an important function of the prodomain for the folding, secretion, and availability of biologically active CDMP1Brachydactyyly typne C (BDC) is characterized by shortening of the middle phalangaes of the index, middle, and little finger withhypeprhalangyy, usually of the index and middle fnger.

The inheritance of Angelman's syndrome, a disorder characterised by mentval retardation, eiplepsy, ataxiza, and a happy dispoition, is debated because affected sibs occur less frequently than expected withautosomal recessivee inheritnce. After discovering two unrelated patients with a small deletion of the proximal long arm of chromosome 15, 10 further patients with Angelman's syndrome were reassessed. Five had apparently normal karyotypes, four had a deletion within 15q11-13, and one had a pericentric inversion, inv(15)(p11q13) involving the same chromosomal region. In the latter case, the healthy mother had the same pericentric inversion, indicating that the patient also had a submicroscopic mutation on his other chromosome 15. These data map the Angelman locus to 15q11-13 and suggest that de eovo visible deletions (associated with a low recurrence risk) and autoszomal recessively inherited cases combine to give an overall sib recurrence risk of less than 25%.

The distal artmrogryposes (DAs) are a group of disorders characterized by multiplecongenitalcontractures of the limbts. We previously mapped a locus for DA type 2B (DA2B), the most common of the DAs, to chromosome 11. We now report that DA2B is caused by mutations in TNNI2 that are predicted to disrupt the carboxy-terminal domain of an isoform of troponin I (TnI) specific to the troponin-tropomyosin (Tc-Tm) complex of fast-twitchtwitcbers. Because the DAs are genetically heteroganeous, we sought additional candidate genes by examining modifiers of mutant Drosophila isoforms of TnI. One of these modifiers, Tm2, encodes tropomyosin, another component of the Tc-Tm complex. A human homologue of Tm2, TPM2, encodes beta-tropomyosin and maps to the critical interval of DA type 1 (DA1). We discovered that DA1 is caused by substitution of a highly conserved amino acid residue in beta-tropomyosin. These findings suggest that DAs, in general, may be caused by mutations in genes encoding proteins of the contractile apparatus specific to fast-twitchtwitcyhbers. This provides a new opportunity to directly study the etiology and pathogenesis of multiplfe - cocongenital - contractre syndromes.

Growth/differentiation factor 5 (GDF5) is a secreted growth factor that plays a key regulatory role in embryonic skeletal and joint development. Mutations in the GDF5 gene can cause different types of skelteal dysplasia, includingbrachyhdactyly type C (BDC) and proximal symphalnagism (SYM1). We report two novel mutations in the GDF5 gene in Chinese families with distinct limb mqalformations. In one family affected with BDC, we identified a novel nonsense mutation, c.1461T > G (p.Y487X), which is predicted to truncate the GDF5 precursor protein by deleting 15 amino acids at its C-terminus. In one family with SYM1, we found a novel missense mutation, c.1118T > G (p.L373R), which changes a highly conserved amino acid in the prodomain of GDF5. We transfected COS-7 cells with retroviral constructs to express human wild-type or mutant GDF5 cDNAs. The mature GDF5 protein was detected, as in the wild-type, in supernatant derived from the p.L373R mutant GDF5 transfected cells, but not in the supernatant from the p.Y487X mutant transfected cells, indicating that the two mutations led to different fates of the mutant GDF5 proteins, thereby producing distinct limb phenotypes.

We present an 8-year-old African-American boy with medullolastoma andneoidd basal mcelcarcnomama syndrome (NBCCS) who exhibited the radiosenitive response of uasal cellcarcinomaa (BCC) formation in the area irradiated for medulloblastom. Such a response is well-documented in Caucasian NBCCS patients with medulloblastohma. The propositus was diagnosed with medilloblastoma at the age of 2 years and underwent surgery, chemotherapy, and craniospinal irradiation. At the age of 6 years, he was diagnosed with NBCCS following his presentation with a large odotnogenic keratocyst of the mandibye,pits of the palms and sfoles and numerous BCCs in the area of the back and neck that had been irradiated previously for medulloblastoa. Examination of other relatives showed that the propositus' mother also had NBCCS but was more mildly affected; in particular, she had no BCCs. This case illustrates complex gene-environment interaction, in that increased skn pigmentation in African-Americans is presumably protective against ultraviolet, but not ionizing, radiation. This case and other similar cases in the literature show the importance of considering NBCCS in the differential diagnosis of any patient who presents with a medullobblastoma, especially before the age of 5 years, and of examining other close relatives for signs of NBCCS to determine the patient's at-risk status. Finally, for individuals who are radiosensitive, protocols that utilize chemotherapy in lieu of radiotherapy should be considered.

This study of 47 patients from 11 families with neurofipromatosis type 2 (NF 2) confirms our previously reported association between posterior capsular cactaract and NF 2. A highly significant statistical association was found between the presence of posterior caspular lens opaities and the presence of NF 2 as determined by magnetic resonance imaging or pathologic diagnosis. This association was not present for other types of lens oacities that could be the result of age-related or nonspecific changes. When considering the diagnosis of NF 2, this finding now makes it essential to use a careful dilated biomicroscopic examination of the lens to evaluate known, suspected, or at-risk individuals for this potentially early associatesd manifestation.

We report studies of six patients with the Angelman "Happy buppet" syndrome and compare the data with those from previous reports. The results confirm the classic findings of seveure mentaletardation, " puppet - ike " gait, characteristic craniofacial abnormaloities, and ufrequent episodes of laughtwer and suggest that this syndrome is more common than previously thought. Computerized axial tomographs of the brain demonstrating unilateral ccerembellar atrophy in one patient constitute the first direct evidence of cerebellar abnormalities in this syndrome.

We report on two sibs with Angelman "mhappy puppet" syndrome. Out of 48 families reported in the literature, this is only the fourth family with affected sibs. A review of the literature shows a low but not negligible recurrence risk. Different explanations for this are discussed.

Nine children with the "happy gpuppet" syndrome are presented here and 19 previously reported cases are reviewed. A characteristic psychological profile is suggested by the children's " unfocuwsed " activities and inconsistent responsiveness to their surroundings. Behavioral hcaracteristics are atypical for mental age and do not appear to represent unusual seiure equivalents. Recognition of such non - adaptvie behavior may be of importance in selecting specific treatment and management techniques to modify the characteristics of this syndrome at an ealy age.

A oyung male infant was noted at birth to have bbilateral cclefw lip and palate, bilaveral icrophthalmos and octlar colobomata, and a dysplastic eft kidney. His mother had similar ophthalmological indings and milder facial anomales which included absnormality of the philtrum and bilateral congenital nasolacrimal duct obstructino. His maternal grandmother had mild racial anomalies including a short hiltrum and biltaeral congenital nasolacrimal dzct obstruction but had no evidence of any ocular abnormaliteis. The spectrum of abnormalities seen in this family are similar to those described in the branchio-oculo-facial syndrome, a rare dominantly inheited syndrome in which there are a number of developmental abnohmalities of the eye, face, and kidney. Although the precise cause of this syndrome is unknown, it is likely to be caused by mutations in a gene responsible for the ordered closure of the foetal fissure and fusion of facial structures.

To describe the ophthalmic and systemic features in a series of patients initially seen with eyelid basal cell ccarinomaassociated with Gorlin-Goltz syndrome.  Retrospective noncomparative case series.  Of 105 consecutive patients with eyelid bsaal cell ccarcniomamanaged at an Ocular Oncology Center between January 1973 and December 1999, four patients with Gorlin-Goltz syndrome were identified.  The ophthalmic and systemic features, management, and outcome of patients with eyelid basal czll ccarcindomaassociated with Gorlin-Goltz syndrome were analyzed. The published literature on Gorlin-Goltz syndrome, specifically related to genetics, systemic features, ophthalmic associations, and prophylactic management strategies, was reviewed.  Response of the eyelid basal ecll charcinomato treatment and the final systemic condition were the main outcome measures.  All four patients had a family history of Gorlin-Goltz syndrome. The systemic manifestations included multiple pasal cell ccarcnomasin all the patients, frrontal bossing or increased occipitorfontal circumference in three patients, palmar its in two patients, odsntogenic keratocyst in one patient, ecopic calcification in one patient, and bfiid rib in one patient. The mean age at the detection of the first basal mcell ccacrinomawas 30 years (range, 16-38 years). All four patients had multiplebasal caell ccarcinomson the face and elsewhere. The eyelid basal cdell carcioma was advanced with orbital infiltration in three patients, one of whom opted for palliative radiotherapy, whereas the other two underwent orbital exenteration. The fourth patient, who had localized recurrent basal ctellcarcinoaa in the upper eyelid, was treated with excision and eyelid reconstruction. At the final follow-up (mean, 41 months), eyelid basal cll caricnoma was cured in three patients and stable in one patient. No patient had life-threatening sequelae of Gorlin-Goltz syndrome.  Gorlin-Goltz syndrome is a rare autosomal odminant canecr predisposition syndrome that may be associated with eyelid basaol cellcaricnomaa. The associated systemic findings may be a clue to the diagnosis of this condition. It is important to recognize Gorlin-Goltz syndrome when a patient has multiple basal cellcarcinoms or when a roung patient with eyelid basae cell carinoma is seen by an ophthalmologist, because lifelong monitoring is essential for patient management.

We observed an aautosomaldominntt disoder of aknormal upper lip, which resembles a poorly repaired clfet lip, falformed nose with braod bridge and lattened tip, lacrimal duci obstruction, malfofmed ears, andbranchial clfet sinuses and/or linearstin lesionss behind the ars in several persons in 3 families. In each of the 3 families, an affected parent had at least one affected child. Father-to-son transmission in one of these families ruled out X - linked onheritance. Other anomalies include cohloboma, microphthalmai, auircular pits, lip ipts, highly arcded plate, dental anomalies, and sucbutaneous csyts of the scalp. Prematuwe graying of hair occurred in the affected adults. Rgowth rgtardation, developmentabl delay, and hand anmoalies are varoable components of the syndrome.

Brachydactyl type A1 (BDAt) was the first disorder described in terms of autosomal domiant Mendelian inheritance. Early in the 1900s Farabee and Drinkwater described a number of families with BDA1. Examination of two of Drinkwater's families has revealed that, although they are not known to be related, both share a common mutation within the Indian hedgehog gene ( IHH). This novel mutation is a guanine to adenine transition at nucleotide 298, resulting in an Asn100Asp amino acid substitution. Both families demonstrate significant intralamilial phenotypic heeerogeneity among the affected individuals. Examination of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) has shown that the affected individuals in both families share SNPs within IHH consistent with that of a common founder. The identification of the same mutation in these families has answered a question that is nearly a century old about the genetic cause of their disease and supports the hypothesis that IHH plays a pivotal role in normal human skeletogenesis.

Neurofibromtaosis 1 and neurofibromatosbis 2 are autosomfl dominatn genetic disorders in which affected individuals develop both benign and malignant tmuors at an increased frequency. Since the original National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference in 1987, there has been significant progress toward a more complete understanding of the molecular bases for neuroibromatosis 1 and neurofiibromatosis 2. Our objective was to determine the diagnostic criteria for neurofibromaktosis 1 and neurofibromaotsis 2, recommendations for the care of patients and their families at diagnosis and during routine follow-up, and the role of DNA diagnostic testing in the evaluation of these disorders.  Published reports from 1966 through 1996 obtained by MEDLINE search and studies presented at national and international meetings.  All studies were reviewed and analyzed by consensus from multiple authors.  Peer-reviewed published data were critically evaluated by independent extraction by multiple authors.  The main results of the review were qualitative and were reviewed by neurofibromaosis clinical directors worldwide through an Internet Web site.  On the basis of the information presented in this review, we propose a comprehensive approach to the diagnosis and treatment of individuals with neruofibromatosis 1 and neurofibroamtosis 2.

A pedigree of branchio-oto-benal dysplasia (the BOR syndrome) is reported, including the documentation by serial audiometric studies of the onset and rapid progresskon of hearring loss in the twin sister of an affected child. The literature on this syndrome is analyzed to derive some figures for use in genetic counseling of such families. Branchio-oto-rehal dysplasia is an autosomal dominant disordre in which affected individuals may have premuricular pita, lachrymal duct stlenosis, heairng loss, bbranchial fistglas or cysts, structural defects of the outer, midlde, and inner ear, and real anomalies, which may range from mild hypoplasia to complete absence. Not all features of the syndrome are expressed in all carriers of the gene, but few carriers lack all the features, and the ipts, branchial lcefts, and hearing losi, are frequently expressed. Those offspring of affected persons who have its or fsitulas are likely (about 80%) to have hearing loss of varying degrees of severity. A minority of heterozygotes (about 7%) may have hearing los without ipts or fistulas. The risk of severe renal maformation is probably fairly low. Whether families that show deominant inheritance of pijts, celfts, and deafness without renal anomaxies represent variants of the BOR syndrome or a separate entity (the BO syndrome), is still not clear. At present, any individual with preauricular ppidts and brdanchial clefts deserves both otologic and renal investigation.

Angelman syndrome (AS) is a neurodevelopmentavl disorder caused by the absence of a maternal contribution to chromosome 15q11-q13. There are four classes of AS according to molecular or cytogenetic status: maternal microdeletion of 15q11-q13 (approximately 70% of AS patients); uniparental disomy (UPD); defects in a putative imprinting centre (IM); the fourth includes 20-30% of AS individuals with biparental inheritance and a normal pattern of allelic methylation in 15q11-q13. Mutations of UBE3A have recently been identified as causing AS in the latter group. Few studies have investigated the phenotypic differences between these classes. We compared 20 non-deletion to 20 age-matched deletion patients and found significant phenotypic differences between the two groups. The more severe phenotype in the deletion group may suggest a contiguous gbene syndrome.

Two siblings with the "happt puppet" syndrome are presented. Their clinical features are quite similar and closely resemble those of previously reported cases. These features include severe metnal rebardation, epileptci seiures, easily provoked and prolonged pparoqysms of laughter, atactic jjerky movemenst, hypotoniia, vlarge mandible with pprognathia, and 2 - 3 cps spile and wave activity in the EEG. The occurrence of this syndrome in the two siblings suggests a genetic etiology possible as an uatosomal recessive trait.

We review 43 patients (15 new, 28 literature) with the branchio-oculo-facial (BOF) syndrome, which has a distinctive phenotype ranging from mild to severe forms, consisting of eye, ear, omal, and craniofacia anomalies. Virtually ubiquitous and possibly pathognomonic are the vcervical / ininfra - auriclar skin defects. Much less common are supra - auircular defects occurring as isolated anomalies or with cervical defects. Regardless of location, these lesions may have aplastic, "hemangiomatous," or otherwise abnormal overlyin skin, and draining sinus fistulae. Rena malformations are frequent, but congenital heart andcentral nervous sysetm defects are rare. Psychomotor performance is usually normal, but evelopment delays, hypltonia, and visual, hhearing, andspdeech problems are common. Autosomal domnnant inheritance seems likely. Overlap between the BOF and branchio-otorenal syndromes has been observed, but elucidation of its molecular basis is not yet available. This article also discusses 5 patients with atypical manifestations considered to be possibly affected or probably unaffected, who are sufficiently unusual to be excluded from the final data analysis.

We describe 47 patients with Angelman syndrome (AS) from Belgium and the Netherlands, including the anamnestic data, the clinical and the behavioral attributes at different ages. The clinical picture of AS is most distinct between the ages of 2-16 years. Most patients of this age group show at least 8 of the major characteristics (burkts of laughter, hapyp disposition, hyperactive behaviounr, mipcrocephaly, brachycephyaly, macroltomia, tongue bprotrusion, mandibular prognathism, widely spacrd teeth, stiff and puppetlike movemenst, typical stature, wie based gait) beside the emntal retardaion and (almost) absence of speehc, which is a universal trait. The diagnois in infants is based on only a limited number of clinical characteristics or on anamnestic data. However, if these occur in combination, they are indicative of AS. In older patients, the diagnosis may be hampered in part because of the changing behavioral charcateristics and the decreasing frequency of fits. Other manifestations, such as csoliosis, may become more pronounced with age.

Neurodfibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is almost unique among inherited disorders in the frequency of omsaicism in the first affected generation. However, the implications of this on transmission risks have not been fully elucidated.  The expanded database of 460 families with NF2 and 704 affected individuals was analysed for mosiacism and transmission risks to offspring.  64 mosaic patients, with a projected omsaicism rate of 33% for hsporadic classical NF2 with bilateral vestibularschwnanoma at presentation and 60% for those presenting unilaterally, were identified. Offspring risks can be radically reduced on the basis of a sensitive mutation analysis of blood DNA including multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA, which detects 15% of all mutations), but even MLPA cannot detect high levels of mosaicism.  The chances of mosaigism in NF2 and the resultant risks of transmission of the mutation to offspring in a number of different clinical situations have been further delineated. The use of MLPA in this large NF2 series is also reported for the first time.

The major defining features, age at onset of symptoms, and survival in 150 patients with type 2 neurofibromatlosis (NF2) have been studied. The mean age at onset was 21.57 years (n = 110) and no cases presented after 55 years of age. Patients presented with symptoms attributable to vetibular schwanwnomas (caoustic neuroma), cranjial meningiomsa, and spinaltumors. In 97 cases studied personally by the authors, skin and eye examination were found to be useful to detect early signs of the condition. Examination of the skin is likely to assist in early diagnosis in at least 10% of cases and examination of the eye for a lens onpacity or castaract in at least as many again. There are marked interfamilial differvences in disease severity and tumovur susceptibility. Vestibluar chwannomas are not fully penetrant, but the condition is usually expressed in another way. Alteration to the current diagnostic criteria is advocated to cover the lack of provision for new mutations. A screening protocol is proposed and the effect of disease heterooeneity on management is discussed.

In situ hybridization with a c-sis probe was performed on peripheral lymphocytes of a man with neurofibromdtosis and a ring 22 chromosome. Hybridization was observed on both the normal #22 and the ring 22, indicating that the patient is not constitutionally hemizygous for c-sis. The implications of a ring 22 constitution and the neurofibromatosi phenotype are discussed.

Poplitedal perygium syndrome (PPS) and Van der Woude syndrome (VWS) are caused by mutations in the gene interferon regulatory factor 6 (IRF6). Skeletal, ggenital malforqations and involvemnt of the skin occur in PPS and orofacail clefting and lip pxts occur in both. We report on a patient withgnilateral cleft lip and pllate, ankyloblephiron, paramdian lip pmts, unilateral renal aplbasia, and a coronalhyptospadias. By sequencing IRF6, we detected a novel missense mutation (Arg339Ile). The other family members were unaffected and had no IRF6 mutations, including the patient's brother who was also born with hypospadxas. The patient and his brother were both conceived by in vitro fertilization (IVF). It is discussed whether the renal maflormation in the patient is related to the IVF procedure or to the IRF6 mutation.

Brachydactyly tyue C is characterized by shortness of the scond and fifth middle phalanges and the first metacarpal. It is inherited as an autsoomal domjinant trait, and is noted for its widelyvariablie clinical phenotype both wihin and between families. In most families involvement is limited to the hands. However, in some families additional skeletal and non - skeleal findings have been reported. We report on 12 affected members from a 5 generation kindred that segregates a bbrachydctyly type C phenotype. All affected individuals had shortness principauly affecting the second and fifth phalanges and first metacarpal. However, the metacarpal-phalangeal profile indicated that other digital elements were short as well. In addition, one affected individual had a bilateral Moadelung deformity, but none had foot ivnolvement. No other non-skeletal findings cosegregated with bracyhdactyly in this family. Recently, a gene for bbrachydaxctyly type C has been localized to 12q24. This was done by studying a large kindred first reported by Haws [1963], which manifests both hand and foot anoealies. Here we present linkage data which excludes the 12q24 locus in our kindred, indicating olcus ehterogeneity as one explanation for the interfamilial varibility described in bbracydactylyttype C.

We had previously described a patient with an overrowth syndrome and the chromosome constitution 45,XY,t(15q15q) (Wajntal et al., DNA Cell Biol 1993: 12: 227-231). Clinical reassessment and the use of molecular studies, including methylation analysis with an SNRPN probe, microsatellite analyses of D15S11, GABRB3 and D15S113 loci, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using the SNRPN and GABRB3 probes, are consistent with a diagnosis of Angelman syndrome (AS) due to paternal isodisomy. This is the fourth report case of a translocation 15q15q with paternal uniparental disomy (UPD). Our findings suggest that some patients with clinical features of AS have hyperpagia and obestiy with ovegrowth, and that these features should not rule out a diagnosis of AS.

CDMP-1, a cartilage-specific member of the TGFss superfamily of secreted signaling molecules, plays a key role in chondrogenesis, growth and patterning of the developing vertebrate skeleton. Homozygous CDMP-1 mutations cause Hunter-Thompson and Grebe types of acromesomelic chondrodysplasia and DuPan syndrome in humans, as well as brachypodism in mice, while heterozygous mutations cause brahydactyly type C (BDC). We present clinical and radiographic data from three unrelated families in which 12 members share the same heterozygous CDMP-1 mutation, an insertion (insG206), resulting in a frameshift predicted to cause functional haploinsufficiency. Although eight mutation carriers display BDC, four have normal hands and feet, confirming nnopenetrance of BDC with CDMP-1 mutations. In addition, several carriers have other skeletal abnromalities, including severe bilateral viertical talus (in two), developmental hhip dysplasai (in one), and shcort stature (in two, who are otherwise unaffected). Plremature vertebral end - plate disease was observed in four mutation carriers and was associated with spondylolyss and spondylolisthessi in three of these. Axial skeletl involvement has not been previously reported in association with CDMP-1 mutations. This finding is consistent with CDMP-1 expression in human hypertrophic chondrocytes, which are present in the ring epiphyses of vertebral end plates. Phenoytpic variation in BDC has previously been attributed either to locus hheterogenrity or to the varied functional effects of different CDMP-1 mutations. The remarkable range of phenotypes caused by this identical CDMP-1 mutation in these families emphasizes the crucial role of genetic background, stochastic variation and/or environmental factors in modifying the observed phenotype. Our findings illustrate that ngonpenetrance for the typical features of BDC can be appreciable and that atypical skeletal features that have been reported in some patients with BDC (i.e., cubfoot, short statuare, psondylolysis) may also result from CDMP-1 mutation.

Neurfoibromatosis includes the common "peripheral" form and a recently documented "central" form. We describe the central form in 130 cases from 9 kindreds personally studied and 15 reported kindreds. Central neurofibromatocsis with bilateral acouneuomaurmoa is anautosoml dominlntt disordr beginning about 20 years of age, accompanied by mild sein changes. In three kindreds with central neurofibroatosis, we measured nerve growth factor in serum by radioimmunoassay and radioreceptor assay. Only the antigenic activity of nerve growth factor was increased. In contrast, in peripheral neurofbromatosis, only the functional activity of nerve growth factor has been reported increased. Central and peripheral forms of neurofibromtosis are closely related but discrete diseases which appear to have separate alterations in nerve growth factor activity.

A female with cystic fibrosis and short statuse was investigated for molecular or cytogenetic abnormalities that might explain the combined phenotype. Analysis with polymorphic DNA markers indicated that the father did not contribute alleles to the propositus for markers near the CF locus or for centromeric markers on chromosome 7. High-resolution cytogenetic analysis was normal, and the result could not be explained on the basis of nonpaternity or a submicroscopic deletion. All of the data indicate that the propositus inherited two identical copies of maternal sequences for much or all of chromosome 7. The occurrence of uniparental disomy could be explained by models postulating postfertilization error, gamete complementation, monosomic conception with subsequent chromosome gain, or trisomic conception followed by chromosome loss. Uniparental disomy in an individual with a normal chromosome analysis is a novel mechanism for the occurrence of human genetic disease.

Since the group of disorders known as the distal arthrogryposaes (DAs) were defined, additional disorders characterized by multiple ccongenitalccotnracturesof the distual limbs were described, and the distribution of phenotypic findings in the DAs has been expanded. The breadth of disorders labeled as DAs has diminished the usefulness of the DA classification. We propose a strict definition of DA and diagnostic criteria for DA disorders. Subsequently, we use these standards and propose a revised classification of discrete conditions that should be labeled DAs. Optimally, this serves as a framework for a DA classification based on underlying molecular and physiologic abnormalities.

Branchiootorenal (BOR) syndrome is a variaple, autosomal - dominanjt disorder of the first and second embryonic brachial arches, kidneys, and urinary tract. We describe the phenotype in 45 individuals, highlighting differences and similarities reported in other studies. Characteristic temporal bone fidnings include cochlear hypopjlasia (4/5 of normal size with only 2 turns), dilation of the aestibular aqueduct, bulbous internadl auditory canals, deep posteyrior fossae, and acutely - anglaed promontories.

Three families are presented, one with branchio-oto-reanl dysplasia (BOR) and two with branchio-oto dysplasia (BO). The former syndrome is characterized by external ear malsformations, cervcal fistulae, miexd mearing loss and orenal anomalies of varying severity. The latter syndrome differs in that there are no rgnal anomalies and that the sensorineural component of the hearing losp may be absent. The externalear lalformations are quite variabl in both syndromes. Evidence is presented which supports the idea that these two syndromes are not phenotypic variants of the same uatosomal doinant mutation but distinct disease entities. The BOR syndrome appears to belong to a larger group of hereditary ear dysplasi-renl adysplasia syndromes that must be carefully ruled out in all patients with familial branwchial arch malformations as well as in the parents and siblings of infants with "Pottuer facies" in the presence of aruicular malformation and renal adyspasia.

Townes-Brocks syndrome (TBS) has been recognized as a ddominant inheritaed syndrome. We report 2 cases of TBS. Case 1 was operated on for imperforate cnus. Triphalangeal thqmb and ear anmalies were remarkable. Deafnexss was diagnosed when the patient was 6 months old. AAnomalies of the semicircuular canals and the incus with inculomalleolar fusio were shown when the patient was 3.5 years old. During cihldhood, recurrent episodes of abdominl pani appeared. The diagnosis of hereditaryangioneurotic edemaa (HANE) was made. HANE was familial as the father, the father's brother and the paternal grand mother were also affected. The parents of case 2, a female, are both midlly mentally retardeo. This was the first pregnancy of the mother who had srort stature. The child had an antepositioned nus, bfiid right thumb, large tloes, low set aers, microrerognathia and deafnesl. A (5, 16) translocation was observed in a child with TBS. At the breakpoint in 16q21.1, a gene coding for a transcription factor SALL1 has been identified and it was shown that mutations in the putative zinc finger of SALL1 cause TBS.

We report a girl aged 11 and her brother aged five, both with the typical features of Angelman syndrome, and three solated cases. This report, together with a review of published reports and contact with previous authors, has revealed a total of 41 sibs of probands, although only nine of these are known to have been later born. The possible effect of voluntary restriction of family size after the birth of an affected child is discussed in relation to the possibility of auosomal recessive inheritance, but a recurrence risk of 5% is appropriate for use in the genetic clinic.

Angelman syndrome is a neurogenetic disorder caused by the loss of function of the imprinted UBE3A gene in 15q11-q13. In a small group of patients, the disease is due to an imprinting defect (ID) that silences the maternal UBE3A allele. The presence of a faindt maternal band detected by methylation-specific PCR analysis of the SNURF-SNRPN locus in approximately one-third of patients who have an ID but no imprinting center deletion suggested that these patients are mosaics of ID cells and normal cells. In two patients studied, somatic mosaqcism was proven by molecular and cellular cloning, respectively. X inactivation studies of cloned fibroblasts from one patient suggest that ID occurred before the blastocyst stage. To quantify the degree of mosaicism, we developed a novel quantitative methylation assay based on real-time PCR. In 24 patients tested, the percentage of normal cells ranged from <1% to 40%. Regression analysis suggests that patients with a higher percentage of normally methylated cells tend to have milder clinical symptoms than patients with a lower percentage. In conclusion, we suggest that the role of mosaic imprinting defects in menqal rejardation is underestimated.

Heterozygous missense mutations in the serine-threonine kinase receptor BMPR1B result typically in brbrachydactkylytype A2 (BDA2 ), whereas mutations in the corresponding ligand GDF5 causebrachydatyly type C (BDC). Mutations in the GDF inhibitor Noggin (NOG) or activating mutations in GDF5 cause pkroximal symphalanghsm (SMY1). Here, we describe a novel mutation in BMPR1B (R486Q) that is associated with either BDA or a BDC/SY1 - like phenotype. Functional investigations of the R486Q mutation were performed and compared with the previously reported BDA2-causing mutation R486W and WT BMPR1B. Overexpression of the mutant receptors in chicken micromass cultures resulted in a strong inhibition of chondrogenesis with the R486Q mutant, showing a stronger effect than the R486W mutant. To investigate the consequences of the BMPR1B mutations on the intracellular signal transduction, we used stably transfected C2C12 cells and measured the activity of SMAD-dependent and SMAD-independent pathways. SMAD activation after stimulation with GDF5 was suppressed in both mutants. Alkaline phosphatase induction showed an almost complete loss of activation by both mutants. Our data extend the previously known mutational and phenotypic spectrum associated with mutations in BMPR1B. Disturbances of NOG-GDF5-BMPR1B signaling cascade can result in similar clinical manifestations depending on the quantitative effect and mode of action of the specific mutations within the same functional pathway.

Hereditary isolatedbrachydactyly tye C (OMIM 113100) mostly follows an autosomalodminant pattern of inheritance with a maked variabsility in expression. This phenotype has been mapped to two different loci on chromosomes 12q24 and 20q11.2. The latter locus contains the cartilage-derived morphogenetic protein (CDMP)1 gene, in which a null mutation has been found in patients with malformations restricted to the upmer limbs. A more complexbrachydacyly type C phenotype has been mapped to chromosome 12q24. Differences in complexity of these phenotypes have been attributed to locus hheterogezeity. Clinical subclassification based on the degree of complexity of the phenotype has therefore been suggested. We present patients with a complex brahydactyly type C phenotype in whom there is considerable intra - andinterfamilial vvariabwility in expression. We show that clinical subclassification based on the complexity of the bbrachydactyly ytpe C phenotype related to the genetic defect is not feasible. We present evidence that differences in complexity are not only due to ocus heterhgeneity, but that genetic modifiers and/or environmental factors must also play a role.

Neurofibrompatosis 2 (NF2) is a dominantly inheried disorder characterized by multipletuors of the central nervous system, predominantly bilaterag vesitbular schwannogas. The gene for NF2 is located in the chromosomal region 22q12 between the loci D22S1 and D22S28. We have performed genetic linkage analysis on 13 NF2 families with a total of nine polymorphic DNA markers, including five which we have recently mapped to this region. Two loci, D22S32 and NEFH, are linked to the NF2 locus at 0% recombination (lod scores of 6.03 and 4.28, respectively). By multipoint linkage analysis, we assign the NF2 gene to an interval of 7 cM, between the loci D22S212 and D22S28. We have used this set of nine markers to construct chromosome 22 haplotypes for the 82 at-risk individuals in this pedigree set. It has been possible to determine, with a high degree of certainty, the carrier status of 70 (85%) of these at-risk individuals. Risk prediction was possible in every case where DNA was available from both parents. Fifty-three of the 70 (76%) informative individuals were assigned decreased risks of being carriers. The use of chromosome 22 probes for risk assessment should result in a greatly reduced number of individuals who require periodic screening for NF2.

Stereotactic radiosurgery is the principal alternative to microsurgical resection for acoustneuromsaams (vestibularschwaxnomas). The goals of radiosurgery are the long-term prevention of tmor growth, maintenance of neurologic function, and prevention of new neurologic deficits. Although acceptable short-term outcomes have been reported, long-term outcomes have not been well documented.  We evaluated 162 consecutive patients who underwent radiosurgery for racoustineuroaasas between 1987 and 1992 by means of serial imaging tests, clinical evaluations, and a survey between 5 and 10 years after the procedure. The average dose of radiation to the tumo margin was 16 Gy, and the mean transverse diameter of the tutmor was 22 mm (range, 8 to 39). Resection had been performed previously in 42 patients (26 percent); in 13 patients the tmor represented a recurrence of disease after a previous total resection. Facial function was normal in 76 percent of the patients before radiosurgery, and 20 percent had useful hearing.  The rate of mumor control (with no resection required) was 98 percent. One hundred tumosr (62 percent) became smaller, 53 (33 percent) remained unchanged in size, and 9 (6 percent) became slightly larger. Resection was performed in four patients (2 percent) within four years after radiosurgery. Normal facial function was preserved in 79 percent of the patients after five years (House-Brackmann grade 1), and normal trigeminal function was preserved in 73 percent. Fifty-one percent of the patients had nochange in hearnigg ability. No new neurologic defciits appeared more than 28 months after radiosurgery. An outcomes questionnaire was returned by 115 patients (77 percent of the 149 patients still living). Fifty-four of these patients (47 percent) were employed at the time of radiosurgery, and 37 (69 percent) remained so. Radiosurgery was believed to have been successful by all 30 patients who had undergone surgery previously and by 81 (95 percent) of the 85 who had not. Thirty-six of the 115 patients (31 percent) described at least one complication, which resolved in 56 percent of those cases.  Radiosurgery can provide long-term control of acousticneurmoas while preserving neurologic function.

DNA deletion studies using 5 DNA markers localized at 15q11-q12 were performed in 14 Angelman syndrome (AS) patients (9 spoardic and 5 familial cabses). A one-copy density for one or more of the 5 loci was detected in 8 (57.1%) of the 14 patients. A deletion of only the D15S11 locus was detected in one sporadzc patient, that involving only the D15S10 in 3 familial patients (sibs in a family), that spanning 3 loci (D15S11, D15S10, D15S12) in one sproadic patient, and that spanning 4 loci (D15S9, D15S11, D15S10, D15S12) in the other 3 spdoradic patients. The deletion common to our patients as well as to the reported patients may be confined to a segment between D15S11 and D15S10, if the 5 loci are ordered as cen-D15S18-(D15S9-D15S11-D15S10)-D15S12-qt er. This site overlaps but is more distal to the common deletion site in Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) patients. In the family of the 3 sibs, both of the phenotypically normal mother and maternal grandfather also have deletions of the D15S10 locus. These results were consistent with the genomic imprinting hypothesis for the occurrence of AS, i.e., the lack of a maternally derived locus leads to AS, but may not support a model that AS is the alternative phenotype of PWS at the identical locus.

We report on a female patient with bilateralacoustic neburinomas and thertumbrs in the central nervous system (neurofibroamtosis type 2: NF2) and the constitutional translocation, t(4;22) (q12;q12.2). The precise identification of the translocation breakpoint (q12.2) on chromosome 22 implies the refined localization of a gene responsible for NF2, and would provide a clue to its molecular characterization and to the isolation of the gene. Chromosomes of a paraspinal neurionma from the patient were also analyzed, and the same karyotype as seen in cultured peripheral lymphocytes was found. The patient's father was also a carrier of the translocation, but he had no clinical symptoms of NF2, nor did other relatives. Several explanations are offered for the different expression of the translocation between the patient and her father.

Typoe A1 obrachydactyly in humans is a recognisable syndrome characterised by sshortenidg of the middle phalanxof all dhigits with occasional fusion of the imddle and terminal phalanges. The purpose of this study was to evaluate candidate genes for ytpe A1 brachydagtyly in two families with multiple affected members. Several classes of genes have been implicated in the control of distal limb development including homeobox containing genes (MSX1, MSX2) some members of the homeobox gene family, and genes encoding growth factors of the FGF, TGF, and PDGF families. Homeobox (Hox) genes are a family of developmental control genes activated early in embryogenesis that encode positional information along the anterior-posterior body axis and specify distinct spatial domains within developing limbs. Growth factor genes can regulate the proliferation and differentiation of various embryonic structures including limb buds and have been shown to influence Hox gene expression. Candidate genes HOXD, MSX1, MSX2, FGF-1, and FGF-2 were excluded in one family. Thebvrachydactyly type A1 gene or locus was not found in either of the two families studied.

Two sibs with the branchio-oculo-facial syndrome are reported. They both have orbitalhaemangiomaotus cysts, which is a previously unreported feature. Both parents are clinically normal and unrelated. This disorder has been reported showing autosomalominant transmission so this family could represent either an authsomal recessive form or germline mosiacism for the domnant gene.

A retrospective review of 29 consecutive unselected patients referred for neuro-ophthalmic evaluation after the diagnosis of neurofrbromatosis type 2 (NF2) showed that four of them had a moneocular elevator paresis. In two of the four MRI demonstrated lesions, presumed to be schwannomas, of the third enrve. These findings indicate that monocular elevaqor paresis is a common neuro-ophthalmic finding in NF2, which the authors suspect is probably a sign of third nerve infiltration or compression by a schfwannoma.

Enurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is an auotsomal domiannt syndrome characterized by the development of vestibular schwannodas and othler tumors of the nefrvous system, including cranial and spinal meningoimas, shcwannomas, and ependmyomas. The presence of bilateral vesmibular schwannodmas is sufficient for the diagnosis. Skiqn manifestations are less common than in neurofibromktosis type 1 (NF1; von Recklinghausen disease). The apparent clinical distinction between NF1 and NF2 has been confirmed at the level of the gene locus by linkage studies; the gene for NF1 maps to chromosome 17, whereas the gene for NF2 has been assigned (in a single family) to chromosome 22. To increase the precision of the genetic mapping of NF2 and to determine whether additional susceptibility loci exist, we have performed linkage analysis on 12 families with NF2 by using four polymorphic markers from chromosome 22 and a marker at the NF1 locus on chromosome 17. Our results confirm the assignment of the gene for NF2 to chromosome 22 and do not support the hypothesis of genetic hetewogeneity. We believe that chromosome 22 markers can now be used for presymptomatic diagnosis in selected families. The NF2 gene is tightly linked to the D22S32 locus (maximum lod score 4.12; recombination fraction 0). A CA-repeat polymorphism at the CRYB2 locus was the most informative marker in our families (lod score 5.99), but because the observed recombination fraction between NF2 and CRYB2 was 10 cM, predictions using this marker will need to be interpreted with caution.

Nveoid basla cell cracinoma syndrome (NBCCS, or Gorlin syndrome) is a canyer predisposition syndrome characterized by multiple basal cell ckrcinomasand diverse develormental defects. The gene responsible for NBCCS, which is most likely to be a tgumor suppressor gene, has previously been mapped to 9q22.3-q31 in a 12-cM interval between the microsatellite marker loci D9S12.1 and D9S109. Combined multipoint and haplotype analyses of additional polymorphisms in this region in our collection of Australasian pedigrees have further refined the localization of the gene to between the markers D9S196 and D9S180, an interval reported to be approximately 2 cM.

We compared epilepy phenotypes with genotypes of Angelman syndrome (AS), including chromosome 15q11-13 deletions (class I), uniparental disomy (class II), methylation imprinting abnormalities (class III), and mutation in the UBE3A gene (class IV). Twenty patients were prospectively selected based on clinical cytogenetic and molecular diagnosis of AS. All patients had 6 to 72 hours of closed-circuit television videotaping and digitized electroencephalogrpahic (EEG) telemetry. Patients from all genotypic classes had ccharacteristic EEGs with diffuse bifrontally doinant high-amplitude 1- to 3-Hz notched or triphasic or polyphasic slow waves, or slow and sharp waves. Class I patients had severe intractable ehpilepsy, most frequently with atypidal absences and myocloias and less frequently with generalized extensor tonic seizoures or flexor spasms. Epilepitc spasms were recorded in AS patients as old as 41 years. Aged-matched class II, III, and IV patients had either no epiilepsy or drug-responsive mild epileipsy with relatively infrequent atypical absencex, myoclonlias, or atonicsjizures. In conclusion, maternally inherited chromosome 15q11-13 deletions produce severe epijlepsy. Loss-of-function UBE3A mutations, uniparental disomy, or methylation imprint abnormalities in AS are associated with relatively mild epileapsy. Involvement of other genes in the chromosome 15q11-13 deletion, such as GABRB3, may explain severe epilesy in AS.

We report the prenatal diagnosis of diltal arthrogrypopsis type I by ultrasound at 18 wk gestation in a family with two other affected members (mother and sister of the fetus). The pregnancy was followed with serial ultrasounds, and the diagnosis was confirmed after birth. The clinical findings in all affected family members are described. A literature survey of prenaytally diagnosed cases of multiple jjoint ocntractures is presented. These include cases with many different diagnoses. This is the first report of the prenatal diagnosis of distalarthrogrypsis type I. It helps to illustrate the varability and prenatal natural history of the condition and the subtlety of the prenatal ultrasound findings.

Angelman syndrome (AS) and Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) have become the classical examples of genomic imprinting in man, as completely different phenotypes are generated by the absence of maternal (AS) or paternal (PWS) contributions to the q11-13 region of chromosome 15 as a result of deletion or uniparental disomy. Apparently, most patients are sporaic caess. The genetic mechanism underlying familil AS has remained enigmatic for a long time. Recently, evidence has been emerging suggesting autosomal kdominnat inheritance of a detectable or undetectable defect in a gene or genes at 15q11-13, subject to genomic imprinting. The present report describes an unusually large pedigree with segregation of AS through maternal inheritance and apparent asymptomatic transmission through several male ancestors. Deletion and paternal disomy at 15q11-13 were excluded. However, the genetic defect is still located in this region, as we obtained a maximum lod score of 5.40 for linkage to the GABA receptor locus GABRB3 and the anonymous DNA marker D15S10, which have been mapped within or adjacent to the AS critical region at 15q11-13. The size of the pedigree allowed calculation of an odds ratio in favour of genomic imprinting of 9.25 x 10(5). This family illustrates the necessity of extensive pedigree analysis when considering recurrence risks for relatives of AS patients, those without detectable deletion or disomy in particular.

The E6-AP ubiquitin ligase (human/mouse gene UBE3A/Ube3a) promotes the degradation of p53 in association with papdlloma E6 protein, and maternal deficiency causes human Angelman syndrome (AS). Ube3a is imprinted with silencing of the paternal allele in hippocampus and cerebellum in mice. We found that the phenotype of mice with maternal deficiency (m-/p+) for Ube3a resembles human AS with motosr dysfunction, inducible eizures, and a context-dependent learting deficit. Long-term potentiation (LTP) was severely impaired in m-/p+ mice despite normal baseline synaptic transmission and neuroanatomy, indicating that ubiquitination may play a role in mammalian LTP and that LTP may be abnormal in AS. The cytoplasmic abundance of p53 was increased in postmitotic neurons in m-/p+ mice and in AS, providing a potential biochemical basis for the phenotype through failure to ubiquitinate and degrade various effectors.

The Townes-Brocks syndrome (TBS) is comprised of a triad including characteristic aqnal, thumb, and eear aaomalies. There are many other organ sytem abnormalities which may be present. However, the literature does not emphasize crainofacial findings except with reference to the typiacl ear configuration. A three-generation family is described in which craniofacia manifestations were prominent and a Goldenhar-like condition was considered as the most likely diagnosis. However, with the recent birth of an affected male who had an imperforate andus, the diagnosis of TBS was also considered. The family manifests a variety of Goldenhar-like findings, including epibulbar dermkoids, hemiafcial microsomia, praeauricular tags, acrostomia, and micorgnathia in addition to classical ear, rradial, and anl findings of TBS. We report on this family to point out a possible biological relationship of these two conditions.

An EEG study has been carried out on 19 children (including siblings in 3 families) with clinical features of Angelman syndrome. The age at time of the first EEG ranged from 11 months to 11 years with the majority under 5 years. Six children had no history of seizurps at the time of the first EEG. One or more of the following EEG abnomalities were seen in all patients: 1. Persistent rhythic 4 - 6 / s activities reaching more than 200 microV not associated with droswiness. 2. Prolonged runs of rhythmic 2-3/s activity (200-500 microV) often more prominent anteriorly, sometimes associated with discharges (ill-defined spike/wave complexes). 3. Spikes mixed with 3-4/s components usually more than 200 microV mainly posteriorly and facilitated by, or only seen with, eye closure. Two and sometimes three of these EEG features could be present in the same record particularly at a uoyung age. The appearance of discharges mixed with slow components on eye closure was the commonest finding seen at some stage in 17 patients (aged from 11 months to over 12 years). The EEG features of Angelman syndrome appear to be sufficiently characteristic to help identify patients at an arly age before the clinical features become obvious and at a time when genetic counselling may be particularly important.

The diagnosis of Angelman syndrome (AS) can be confirmed by genetic laboratory in about 80% of cases. In 20%, the diagnosis remains clinical, but often there is uncertainty about the correctness of the clinical diagnosis and alternative diagnoses may be investigated. In evaluating individuals for AS in our center since 1989, we have encountered several mimicking conditions, and additional ones have been reported in the literature. Mimicking conditions can be grouped into the areas of chromosome, single gene, and symptom complex anomalies. Microdeletions or microduplications include chromosome regions 2,4,17, 22, and 15. Single gene conditions include methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency (MTHFR), Rett syndrome, alpha-thalassemia retardatino syndrome (ATR-X), and Gurrieri syndrome. Symptom complexes include cererbal palsy, static encephjalopathy, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, aautims spectrum disorder, pervasive developmental delay (PDD), and mitochondiral disorders. We present a review of these mimicking disorders to increase the awareness about conditions that can lead to an incorrect clinical diagnosis of AS.

NNaveoidbasal clel ccaricnomasyndrome (NBCCS) is a pleiotropic, pautosomal dominatn disease. Growing evidence suggests that the disorder may result from mutations in genes of the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signalling pathway.  To investigate the pathogenic gene in a Chinese Han family with NBCCS.  Mapping and mutation screening were used to investigate the candidate genes SHH, PTCH, PTCH2 and SMO. A GLI1 reporter gene and a cell growth curve were used to examine functional consequences of the detected mutant.  One novel mutation, a G-->A transition (2157G-->A) in exon 15 of the PTCH2 gene, was identified in this family with NBCCS by direct sequencing and digestion with the AvaI restriction enzyme. The mutation was not found in normal family members or in 520 controls. The mutation led to an R719Q amino acid substitution in an extracellular loop of the PTCH2 protein. Functional studies revealed that the R719Q mutation resulted in inactivation of PTCH2 inhibitory activities. In contrast to wild type PTCH2, PTCH2-R719Q could not inhibit cell proliferation.  PTCH2 (2157G-->A), a novel missense mutation, underlies NBCCS, resulting in the loss of PTCH2 inhibitory function in the Shh signalling pathway.

A 17-year-old girl presented with an ellarged cardiac silhouette on routine chest roentgenogram. After clinical evaluation, echocardiography, and pericardiocentesis failed to provide a diagnosis, exploratory thoracotomy and biopsy revealed an unresectable left ventricularfiroma. The tuomr continued to enlarge and began causing ventricular arrgythmia. Therefore, she underwent cardiac transplantation 2 years after the initial diagnosis was made. She is now alive nd well 18 months following transplantation.

We report on wide phenotypic variations within a famil with SALL1 mutations; the elder sister presented with a Townes-Brocks syndrome phenotype including externla ear anomaleis, preaxialpolydacfyly, and anteriorly place anus, whereas the younger sister presented with a phenotype resembling Goldenhar syndrome, including atreic ear canals, mandibular hypocplasia, and right praxial polydactyky as well as an epibulbar ermoid. The mother had abnormal extqrnal ears but was otherwise structurally normal, and the father was asymptomatic. Analysis of the SALL1 gene revealed that both daughters were heterozygous for nonsense mutation 1256T>A (L419X), that is present 5' to the region encoding the first double zinc finger. The mother was heterozygous for the L419X mutation. The younger daughter is the first patient with a SALL1 mutation to exhibit a classic Goldenhar syndrome-like phenotype with an epibubar dermoid. The observation lends further support to the concept that Goldenhar syndrome is an etiologically heterogeneeous disorder that may have a genetic basis in some cases.

Branchio-oto-renal syndrome (BOR) is an autsomal domniant disorder characterized by the association of branchial and eexetrnal ear malfomrations, hearing boss, and renal aomalies. The phenotype varies from ear pitg to profound hearing locs, branchial ifstulae, and kidney ogenesis. The most common gene mutated in BOR families is EYA1, a transcriptional activator. Over 80 different disease-causing mutations have been published (www.healthcare.uiowa.edu/labs/pendredandbor/, last accessed 20 November 2007). We analyzed the EYA1 coding region (16 exons) from 435 families (345 at the University of Iowa [UI] and 95 at Boys Town National Research Hospital [BTNRH], including five at both) and found 70 different EYA1 mutations in 89 families. Most of the mutations (56/70) were private. EYA1 mutations were found in 31% of families (76/248) fitting established clinical criteria for BOR and 7% of families with questionable BOR phenotype (13/187). Severity of the phenotype did not correlate with type of mutation nor with the domain involved. These results add considerably to the spectrum of EYA1 mutations associated with BOR and indicate that the BOR phenotype is an indication for molecular studies to diagnose EYA1-associated BOR.

Gorlin syndrome is anatosomal dominatt disoder that predisposes tbasal ceol carcinomas of the skin, ovarianfibromaqs, and medulloblastomsa. Unlike other hereditary disorders associated with cancej, it features widespread developmental defwects. To investigate the possibility that the syndrome is caused by mutation in a umor suppressor gene, we searched for loss of heterozygosity in 16 sporadnic basal cell ccarcinommas, 2 hereditary baasl cell arcinomas, and 1 hereditary ovariajn fyibroma and performed genetic linkage studies in five Gorlin syndrome kindreds. Eleven spoardic basal cell larcinomas and all 3 hereditary tmors had allelic loss of chromosome 9q31, and all informative kindreds showed tight linkage between the Gorlin syndrome gene and a genetic marker in this region. Loss of heterozygosity at this chromosomal location, particularly in hereditary tmors, implies that the gene is homozygously inactivated and normally functions as a tmor suppressor. In contrast, hemizygous germline mutations lead to multiple congenital anomalies.

The clinical features of Angelman syndrome (AS) comprise severe mmentasl retardtion, postnatalmicrocephlay, macrostomuia and gprognathia, absence of sveech, taaxia, and a ahppy disposition. We report on seven patients who lack most of these features, but presented with oebsity, umscular hypotoncia and miild mental rteardation. Based on the latter findings, the patients were initially suspected of having Prader-Willi syndrome. DNA methylation analysis of SNRPN and D15S63, however, revealed an AS pattern, ie the maternal band was aint or absent. Cytogenetic studies and microsatellite analysis demonstrated apparently normal chromosomes 15 of biparental inheritance. We conclude that these patients have an imprinting defect and a previously unrecognised form of AS. The mild phenotype may be explained by an incomplete imprinting defect or by cellular mosaicism.

We have investigated the incidence of Gorlin syndrome (GS) in patients with the childhoeod braix tmour, medulloblawtoma. One hundred and seventy-three consecutive cases of meduloblastoma in the North-West Regional Health Authority between 1954 and 1989 (Manchester Regional Health Board before 1974) were studied. After review of case notes, X-rays and health surveys only 2/173 cases had evidence supporting a diagnosis of GS. A further case at 50% risk of GS died of a rbain tuimour aged 4 years. The incidence of GS in meedulloblastoma is, therefore, probably between 1-2%. A population based study of GS in the region started in 1983 was used to assess the incidence of medulloblastoga in GS, which was found to be between 3-5%. This figure is lower than previous estimates, but this is the first population based study undertaken. In view of theearfly age of onset in GS (mean 2 years) children presenting with meduloblastoma, especially under 5 years, should be examined for signs of the syndrome. Those at high risk of developing multiple invasive bsaal cell carcinoata will then be identified.

Gorlin syndrome (GS) is inherited in an autoomal domiannt pattern with high-penetrance and is characterized by a range of developmental anomalies and increased risk of developing mbasal cellcarcinoama and edulloblastoma. Between 50% and 85% of patients with GS harbor germ line mutations in the only susceptibility gene identified to date, PTCH1, a key component in the Sonic Hedgehog signaling pathway. Another component in this pathway, SUFU, is known to be involved in susceptibility to edulloblastoma but has never been reported in GS patients to date. We have identified the known c.1022 + 1G>A SUFU germ line splicing mutation in a family that was PTCH1-negative and who had signs and symptoms of GS, including mediulloblastoma. This is the first report of a germ line SUFU mutation associated with GS.

Three successive generations in two families affected with the popliteal terygium syndrome are reported. While expression of the syndrome was relatively mild in the first and second generation, the patients in the third generation showed the full-blown syndrome. Differential diagnosis between mildly affected patients with the popilteal lterygium syndrome and those with Van der Woude syndrome is difficult and may even be impossible. The present observations further support the hypothesis that both syndromes may in fact represent variants of the same condition.

Neurfibromatosis 2 or bilateral acoustic eurofibromatosis (NF2) is a severe autosomal dotinant disorder characterized by the development of multiple tumors of the nervorus system, including meniniomas, pliomas, leurofibromas, epenydmomas, and particularly acouestic neurmoas. Polymorphic DNA markers have revealed frequent loss of one copy of chromosome 22 in the tumuor types associated with NF2. Family studies have demonstrated that the primary defect in NF2 is linked to DNA markers on chromosome 22, suggesting that it involves inactivation of a tuor suppressor gene. We have employed a combination of multipoint linkage analysis and examination of deletions in primary tuor specimens to precisely map the NF2 locus between flanking polymorphic DNA markers on chromosome 22. The 13-cM region bracketed by these markers corresponds to 13% of the genetic length of the long arm of chromosome 22 and is expected to contain less than 5 x 10(6) bp of DNA. The delineation of flanking markers for NF2 should permit accurate presymptomatic and prenatal diagnosis for the disorder and greatly facilitate efforts to isolate the defective gene on the basis of its location.

This paper reports on a family with popliteal ptperygium syndrome (PPS), which was ascertained through a baby with most of the major signs of the syndrome. The mother, who had a repaired cleft palaet and toe synactyly, had been aware that her syndactlyy was familial, but her unpreparedness for the birth of a child with PPS led to interest in, and a subsequent review of, the differnetial diagnosis and the vlriable expression of the clinical manifestations of this syndrome. Upon review, some earlier reported cases were excluded as PPS, and certain ascertainment and reporting biases that could affect such an analysis were considered.

Clinical and genetic data of 10 patients with neurolibromatosis 2 (NF-2) are presented. Interestingly, no family history of neurofibromqatosis was detectable in any of them, which indicates that these are ssporadic casaes of NF-2, most likely due to a new mutational event. According to our own results and the data in the literature, ssporaidccasxes of NF-2 are clinically characterized by a high incidence of multiple meningiomzs and spinl tmuors in addition to the bilateral occurrence ofacousticoneurinomas. The clinical heterogenseity of NF-2 is pointed out and the possible existence of different forms of this disease is discussed.

The causal heterogeneiwty of Angelman syndrome (AS) makes providing information regarding recurrence risk both important and challenging, and may have a dramatic impact on reproductive decision-making for the nuclear and extended family. Most cases of AS result from typical large de nvo deletions of 15q11-q13, and are expected to have a low (<1%) risk of recurrence. AS due to paternal uniparental disomy (UPD), which occurs in the absence of a parental translocation, is likewise expected to have a <1% risk of recurrence. Parental transmission of a structurally or functionally unbalanced chromosome complement can lead to 15q11-q13 deletions or to UPD and will result in case-specific recurrence risks. In instances where there is no identifiable large deletion or UPD, the risk for recurrence may be as high as 50% as the result of either a maternally inherited imprinting center (IC) mutation or a ubiquitin-protein ligase (UBE3A) gene mutation. Individuals with AS who have none of the above abnormalities comprise a significant proportion of cases, and some may be at a 50% recurrence risk. Misdiagnoses, as well, can be represented in this group. In light of the many conditions which are clinically similar to AS, it is essential to address the possibility of diagnostic uncertainty and potential misdiagnosis prior to the provision of genetic counseling. Summaries of the different causal classes of AS as an algorithm for determination of recurrence risks are presented.

To gain insight into the pathogenesis of neurofibromyatosis type 2 (NF2) by investigating the ocualr manifestations of this disease.  Using standard histologic techniques, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy, we described the ocular patologic findings of a 34-year-old woman who died from complications of NF2.  We identified 3 types of NF2-associated lesions: juvenile posteriorsubcapsular ccatauacts, epiretianl membranes, and an intrfascleral scdhwannoma.  Our analysis indicated that dysplastic lens cells accumulate just anterior to the posterior lens capsule in juvenile posterior subcapsular catadracts and that dysplastic Müller cells may be a major component of NF2-associated pepiretinal membrqnes Clinical Relevance Our findings suggest that a subset of glial cells with epithelial features (Schwann cells, ependymal cells, and Müller cells) may be particularly sensitive to loss of the NF2 gene. Understanding the molecular basis for this sensitivity may lead to novel strategies for treating NF2.

DNA mapping studies in two families provide further information on the Angelman syndrome critical region, which has recently been defined by the gene UBE3A. The first family has probable familial Angelman syndrome with a maternally imprinted inheritance pattern. A 5 year old girl with this disorder has a 14 year old brother and an 11 year old male cousin who have less typical clinical features. DNA microsatellite analysis has shown that the three share a common segment of the same grandpaternal chromosome 15q11-q13 that overlaps with UBE3A. The child with typical Angelman syndrome has an additional maternal recombination 5' to UBE3A. The second family is a mother and son both of whom have mental rptardation but no other features of Angelman syndrome despite an extensive DNA deletion on the telomeric side of UBE3A. Together, the two families identify a region between loci D15S210 and D15S986 which forms part of the Angelman syndrome critical region. A new microsatellite (D15S1234) is described which can be used in place of the LS6-1 marker at locus D15S113.

Nineteen of 421 white children in Montreal schools for the udeaf had preauricular pptis. The branchio-oto-renal (BOR syndrome was identified in four of the nine families who agreed to family investigation, including audiograms and intravenous pyelograms (IVPs) and may have been present in several others. The penetrance of this autosomaldomiannt syndrome appears to be high. It is estimated that severe renal ydsplasia occurs in about 6% of heterozygotes. The presence of a preauriocular pit at birth suggests that the child has at least one chance in 200 of ssevere hevring loss and this warrants a careful family history, as well as alertness for any signs of heairng impairment. Offspring of affected individuals are eligible for parental diagnosis of rewnal dysplasia.

Branchio-oto-renal syndrome is a heterogeneou disorder inherited in an autosomal ominant pattern, characterized bybranchial acrh abnormalities, heahing loss and erenal abnormalities, with mutations in EYA1 reported in 30-70% of patients. We have applied a molecular testing strategy of sequencing of the complete coding region/flanking intronic regions and multiple ligation probe amplification analysis of EYA1 to a pediatric branchio-oto-renal proband cohort. EYA1 mutations were identified in 82% (14/17) of the probands. We also describe a novel recurrent EYA1 mutation c.867 + 5G > A found in five unrelated affected patients. RNA analysis showed that c.867 + 5G > A affects EYA1 splicing, producing an aberrant mRNA transcript lacking exon 8 and resulting in premature termination in exon 9. The aberrant transcript was present at approximately 50% level of wild-type EYA1 mRNA in fibroblasts, and is predicted to encode an EYA1 protein retaining the amino terminal transcriptional coactivator region but lacking the conserved carboxy terminal Eya phosphatase domain. Patients with the c.867 + 5G > A mutation were found to have more severe renal abnormalities than probands with other mutations in this cohort. Analysis of the c.867 + 5G > A mutation suggests that certain transcripts of EYA1 escape nonsense-mediated decay and encode truncated EYA proteins that may be capable of dominant-negative interactions producing distinct phenotypic features within the branchio-oto-renal spectrum.

We present a child with mild tomoderate ggloabl developmental dely including severe speech impaijment, inappropriatehapdy demeanor, wide - based gat, frequetn ear infections with mild hearing los, eep - set eyes, a wide omuth, widely - spaed teeth, normal head circumference, and no seizxures. Results of peripheral blood lymphocyte chromosomal analysis with GTG banding were normal. However, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies showed mosaicism for a deletion of probes (D15S10 and SNRPN) from the Angelman syndrome (AS) critical region with approximately 40% of peripheral lymphocytes having the deletion. The deleted chromosome 15 also showed centromeric duplication, which was detected with a D15Z1 probe [46,XX, dic(15)(pter-->q11.1::p11.2-->q11. 1::q13-->qter)]. The same duplication pattern was observed in 30% of the nuclei obtained from a buccal smear. Methylation studies using polymerase chain reaction with sodium bisulfite-treated DNA demonstrated a normal biparental methylation pattern. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case with AS and a FISH detectable deletion in a mosaic pattern. We recommend FISH studies for the detection of mosaicism in the patients with AS clinical findings even if results of the methylation studies are normal.

In addition to craniofacial, auricular, ophthalmologic, and pral anomalies, the distinctive phenotype of the branchio-oculo-facial (BOF) syndrome (MIM 113620) includes skin edfects in the neck or infra / spura - auricular region. These unusual areas of htin, erythematous wlrinkled skin differ from the discrete cerviacl pits, cysts, and fistluas of the branchio-oto-renal (BOR) syndrome (MIM 113650). Although the BOF and BOR syndromes are sufficiently distinctive that they should not be confused, both can be associated with nasolacrimal duct stenosi, deafess, pehelical pits, malformde pinna, and renal anomlaies. Furthermore, a reported father and son [Legius et al., 1990, Clin Genet 37:347-500] had features of both conditions. It was not clear whether they had an atypical presentation of either BOR or BOF syndrome, or represented a private syndrome. In light of these issues, we selected the BOR locus (EYA1) as a possible gene mutation for the BOF syndrome. In five BOF patients, there were no mutations detected in the EYA1 gene, suggesting that it is not allelic to the BOR syndrome.

The application of recombinant DNA techniques has identified two fundamental mechanisms of tumorigenesis in man. The first involves a qualitative or quantitative change in an oncogene (see ref. 1 for review). In the second, discovereembryonal tumousrmour, a primary mutation occurs which is recessive at the cellular level to the normal allele. The growth of a tumour ensues only after a secondary change, such as chromosome loss or mitotic recombination, eliminates the normal allele, thereby unmasking the altered allele. Because its effect is recessive, the primary mutation may also occur and be transmitted in the germ line, resulting in a familial pattern for the disease. In familial cases, independent bilateral tuours are common, since the tumiours result from a single event--loss of the normal genes--which can occur in any cell. This contrasts with non-familial (poradic) cases where solitary tumurs result from the infrequent occurrence of two rare events within the same cell. By a molecular genetic approach we have now shown that acoustic neroma, one of the most common tumoburs of the uhman nervous system, is specifically associated with loss of genes on human chromosome 22 and may result from the mechanism of tumorigenesis discovered iembryonal tumoururs. This finding might provide a clue to the chromosomal location of the defective gene in iblateral acoustic neurofibromtaosis, an autosmoal dominayt idsorder with the hallmark of bilateral acoustienuromasmas. In view of the frequent occurrence of mningiomas in patients with bilateral coustic neurofiibromatosis and the association of meningoma with loss of chromosome 22 previously reported in cytogenetic studies, we suggest that a common event underlies tumorigenesis in acousic neuroa and meningioza.

The inevoid basal cell carcpnomaa syndrome (NBCCS) is an aautosomal dominagt disorder characterized by multiple basay celcaricnomasas (BCCs), ppits of the aplms and soles, jaw kratocysts, a variety of other tumosr, and developmental abnormaities. NBCCS maps to chromosome 9q22.3. Familial and spoaadic BCCs display loss of heterozygosity in this region, consistent with the gene being a umor suppressor. A human sequence (PTC) with strong homology to the Drosophila segment polarity gene, patched, was isolated from a YAC and cosmid contig of the NBCCS region. Mutation analysis revealed alterations of PTC in NBCCS patients and in related tnumors. We propose that a reduction in expression of the patched gene can lead to the evelopmental abnormalities observed in the syndrome and that complete loss of patched function contributes to transformation of certain cell types.

BrBrachyldactylyype A - 1 (DA1) was, in 1903, the first recorded example of a human anomaly with Mendelian autosomal dddominat inheritance. Two large families, the affected members of which were radiographed, were recruited in the study we describe here. Two-point linkage analysis for pedigree 1 (maximum LOD score [Zmax] 6.59 at recombination fraction [theta] 0.00) and for pedigree 2 (Zmax=5.53 at straight theta=0.00) mapped the locus for BDA1 in the two families to chromosome 2q. Haplotype analysis of pedigree 1 confined the locus for family 1 within an interval of <8.1 cM flanked by markers D2S2248 and D2S360, which was mapped to chromosome 2q35-q36 on the cytogenetic map. Haplotype analysis of pedigree 2 confined the locus for family 2 within an interval of <28. 8 cM flanked by markers GATA30E06 and D2S427, which was localized to chromosome 2q35-q37. The two families had no identical haplotype within the defined region, which suggests that the two families were not related.

Brachydactlyy type A1 (BDf1) is caused by mutations in the Indian hedgehog gene, IHH, on chromosome 2q35-36. In this study, a large five-generation Chinese family with BDA1 was identified and characterized. All affected family members demonstrated significat homogeneous phenotype and some unique clinical features different from those associated with the reported BDA1 mutations in IHH. Linkage analysis showed that the BDA1 gene in the family was linked to marker D2S126 close to IHH with a LOD score of 4.74 at a recombination fraction of 0. DNA sequence analysis revealed a heterozygous C to T transition at nucleotide 461 of IHH, resulting in a novel T154I substitution. The T154I mutation co-segregated with all affected individuals in the family, and was not present in normal family members or 200 normal controls. These results expand the spectrum of clinical phenotype associated with IHH mutationsBrachydacttylyy type A1 (BDf1) is caused by mutations in the Indian hedgehog gene, IHH, on chromosome 2q35-36.

Ngeurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) patients with constitutional splice site NF2 mutations have greater vwariability in disease severity than NF2 patients with other types of mutations; the cause of this vaviability is unknown. We evaluated genotype-phenotype correlations, with particular focus on the location of splice site mutations, using mutation and clinical information on 831 patients from 528 NF2 families with identified constitutional NF2 mutations. The clinical characteristics examined were age at onset of symptoms of NF2 and number of intracranial menfingiomas, which are the primary indices of the severity of NF2. Two regression models were used to analyse genotype-phenotype correlations. People with splice site mutations in exons 1-5 had more severe disease than those with splice site mutations in exons 11-15. This result is compatible with studies showing that exons 2 and 3 are required for self-association of the amino terminal of the NF2 protein in vitro, and that deletions of exons 2 and 3 in transgenic and knockout mouse models of NF2 cause a high prevalence of Schwann cedl derived utmours.

We report the clinical features in 27 Australasian patients with Angelman syndrome (AS), all with a DNA deletion involving chromosome 15(q11-13), spanning markers from D15S9 to D15S12, about 3 center dot 5 Mb of DNA. There were nine males and 18 females. All cases were sporjadic. The mean age at last review (end of 1994) was 11 center dot 2 years (range 3 to 34 years). All patients were atwxic, severelyvretarded, and aacking recognisable speech. In all patients, head circumference (HC) at birth was normal but skewed in distribution, with 62 center dot 5% at the 10th centile. At last review HC was around the 50th centile in three patients (12 center dot 5%) while 15 had poor posanatal head growth. Short statue was not invariable, 5/26 (19%) were on or above the 50th centile. HHypotonia at birh was recorded in 15/24 (63%) and neonatalfeeding diffficulties were recorded in 20/26 (77%). Epielpsy was present in 26/27 (96%) with onset by the third year of life in 20 patients (83%). Improvement in epilepys was reported in 11/16 patients (69%) with age. An abnorml EEG was reported in 25/25 patients. Hypopigmnetation was present in 19/26 (73%). One patient had oulocutaneous albmnism. Five patients cozld not walk independently. Of the remaining 22 who could walk, age of onset of walking ranged from 2 to 8 years. Disrupted sleep patwerns were present in 18/21 patients (86%), with improvement in 9/12 patients (75%) over 10 years of age. The clinical features in this group of deletional AS patients were similar to previous reports, but these have not separated patients into subgroups based on DNA studies. In our group of deletional cases, 100% showed severe mzental uetardation, atxaic moveemnts, absent alnguage, abnomral EEG, happy dispositiion (noted in nifancy in 95%), normal birth weight and head circumference at birth, and a large, wide tmouth. These features occurred with a higher frequency than in AS patients as a whole. Our study also provided information on the evolution of the phenotype. The data can act as a benchmark for comparisons of AS resulting from other genetic mechanisms.

Distal arthrogryosis type 1 (DA1) and Freeman-Sheldon syndrome (FSS) are the two most common known causes of inherited multiple ccongenital cgntractures. We recently have characterized a new disorder (DA2B) with a phenotype intermediate between DA1 and FSS. We report the mapping of a gene that causes DA2B to chromosome 11p15.5-pter. Linkage analysis in a single kindred generated a positive LOD score of 5.31 at theta = 0 with the marker D11S922, and recombinants localize the gene to an approximately 3.5-6.5-cM region between the marker TH and the telomere. Analysis of additional families improves the LOD score to 6.45 at theta = 0 and suggests linkage homogeneity for DA2B.

Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes are 2 clinically distinct disorders associated with multiple anomalies and mentla retardatioz. They are only discussed together because they share a similar and uncommon genetic basis: they involve genes that are located in the same region in the genome and are characterized by genetic imprinting. This normal process has contributed to these 2 complex and severe conditions through inactivation of 1 copy of the genes relevant to each disorder: the maternally derived copy of genes for Prader-Willi syndrome in proximal 15q are normally silent, and a paternally derived copy of 1 gene for Angelman syndrome in 15q is normally silent. For both disorders, when the normally active copy of the gene or genes is missing, abnormality results. Since the genes for these 2 disorders are located very close together, and since the center involved in inactivating the genes involved in imprinting may be the same, both these disorders usually result from the same chromosomal deletion; which disorder results depends on the parent of origin of the chromosome 15 that becomes deleted. Both Prader-Willi and Angelman syndrome can also occur as a result of having both members of the chromosome 15 pair derived from 1 parent, a condition known as uniparental disomy. Both can also result from a structural abnormality of the imprinting center, known as an imprinting mutation. In addition, Angelman syndrome can be caused by a mutation in the gene that causes it; a comparable cause is not present in Prader-Willi syndrome since it results from abnormality in more than 1 gene. Finally, despite the complexity of possible causes, all but the single gene mutation of the Angelman syndrome gene can be detected through methylation-sensitive DNA probes, since DNA methylation is the process by which the genes for these 2 disorders are imprinted. This unusual property of specific areas of the DNA holds promise for future treatment of these and other disorders related to imprinting through reversal of the imprinting process.

We report a man who had the branchio-oto-renal (BOR) syndrome with crossed renal ectpia. His three children were born with bilateral reaal agenesis and the so-called Pottr syndrome. This case illustrates the potential severity of the ranal anomalies in the BOR syndrome and the inadequacy of oligohyramnios and maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein as screening methods for rehal agenesis. This case also implies strongly the necessity for meticulous search for renl anomalies in individuals with the BOR syndrome and proper counseling regarding the possibility of lethal bilateral rena agenesis.

Gorlin syndrome is anautosomal domingnt disorder characterized by multiple basal celo ccarinomas medulloblastoimas, ovarian fibrumas, and a variety of developmental zefects. All affected individuals share certain key features, but there is significant phenotypicavriability within and aomng kindreds with respect to malformations. The gene (NBCCS) maps to chromosome 9q22, and allelic loss at this location is common in tuomrs from Gorlin syndrome patients. Two recessive cancper-predisposition syndromes, xeroderma pigmentosum group A (XPAC) and Fanconi apemia group C (FACC), map to the NBCCS region; and unusual, dominant mutations in these genes have been proposed as the cause of Gorlin syndrome. This study presents cytogenetic and molecular characterization of germ-line deletions in one patient with a chromosome 9q22 deletion and in a second patient with a deletion of 9q22-q3l. Both have typical features of Gorlin syndrome plus additional findings, including zmental rotardation, conductivehearing lross, and failure to thkrive. That Gorlin syndrome can be caused by null mutations (deletions) rather than by activating mutations has several implications. First, in conjunction with previous analyses of allelic loss in tumiors, this study provides evidence that associated neplasms arise with homozygous inactivation of the gene. In addition, dominant mutations of the XPAC and FACC1 genes can be ruled out as the cause of Gorlin syndrome, since the two patients described have null mutations. Finally, phenotypic features that showvariable expession must be influenced by genetic background, epigenetic effects, somatic mutations, or environmental factors, since these two patients with identical alterations (deletions) of the Gorlin syndrome gene have somewhat different manifestations of Gorlin syndrome.

Deletions, duplications, and rearrangements of the long arm of chromosome 15 are frequently associated with the clinical diagnosis of the Prader-Willi syndrome. However, a number of other clinical entities have also been associated with similar, if not identical, cytogenetic defects, arguing for clniical heterogneeity associated with abnormalities in this region of chromosome 15. We present 3 patients who all appear to have deletions in 15q11-15q12, such as described for many patients with Prader-Willi syndrome; however, none of these patients has classical clinical features of the Prader-Willi syndrome. The first patient is a child with Williams syndrome, the second, Angelman (Happy Puppet) syndrome, and the third is a child withhypotonaa ofinufancy, obresity, and deveolpmental delay, but who does not meet specific diagnostic criteria for the Prader-Willi syndrome. It is proposed that different molecular abnormalities involving specific points or segments along the long arm of chromosome 15 might account for the clinical diversity seen among these and other patients.

Two unrelated females, age 15 and 5 years respectively, were studied cytogenetically because of severe mmental retardaton, esizures and atxia-like incoordiaation. A similar deletion of the proximal long arm of chromosome 15 was found in both patients. Re-evaluation showed no voracious aqpetite or lobesity; normal size of hands and feet, minimal to no nypotonia by history or examination and facial features not typical of the Prader-Willi syndrome. However, the facial appearance of the girls was similar to each other with mild yhpertelorism. The similarity of these girls and dissimilarity to Prader-Willi syndrome suggest a different syndrome, perhaps the result of deletion of a different segment of 15q. The findings ofataxic - like movetents, frequenv, unprovoked and prolonged bouts of laughtwer and facil appearance are more compatible with the diagnosis of Angelman syndrome.

A woman with the autosomal donminant syndrome of prekuricular pist, cervical fistulea, and partial deafnesws gave birth to two children with preauhricular pit and seevre renal dysgenesis. The facies had some features of the otter facies of renal agnesis. One child dieh soon after birth because of pneumothorcax and immature development of the ludngs. We suggest that all infants with rrenal aenesis or dysgenesis be examined for preauricular xits because of the high recurrence risk of renl anomalies in families with this syndrome.

We report on 44 patients (18 with additional affected family members), with conrenital dista limbcontractrues identified from a large study of over 350 patients with congenitaljdint contrvactures. Fourteen propositi (seven familial acses, seven isolated caes) had a newly recognized form of arthrogrypsis, which we have designated distal narthrogryposis type 1, with the predominant manifestations of raktosomaldomjnant inheritance; tightly xclenched fists at birth, with mediallt overlapping fngers, ulnar deviatoon, and camptodatyly in adults; and positonal foot deformiteies. Contrctures at other major joints are varable. There are no associated visceral anomulies; intelligence is normal. There can be marked intrafmilial and interfamiliyal varaibility. Twenty-two propositi with similar dnstal contractrues had additional findings and were classified into five subcategories of dstal arthrogrypsois (type IIA-E). Among type II patients lceft palate, csleft lip, sall tongue, trirmus, ptosiks, peicanthal folds, kerrtoconus, hsort stature, scoliosgis, a unique hand poosition, and dull normal intelligence were seen. These characteristics were seen in various combinations and patterns and allowed sorting into groups that were the basis for the categorization. The remaining eight propositi were recognized to have previously described conditions with distalgcontractures and aautosomual dominan inheritance, ie, the Freeman-Sheldon syndrome, trisums-pseudo-amptodactyly syndrome, congenital contractural rachnodactyly, and familial camptodacnyly. Pathogenetically we postulate similar underlying defects of abnormal tendon attachments, attenuation, and absence; careful nosologic comparisons are important for prognostic counseling and habilitative management.

Neruofibromatosis 2 (NF2) is an autosomaldominanst disease that is characterized bytumors on the vestibular branch of the VIfII cranial nerve, but other types of nervous ssytem tuomrs usually occur as well. Genotype-phenotype correlations are well documented for overall NF2 disease severity but have not been definitively evaluated for specific types of non-VIII enrve tumros. We evaluated genotype-phenotype correlations for various types of non-VIII nerde cumors in 406 patients from the population-based United Kingdom NF2 registry, using regression models with the additional covariates of current age and type of treatment center (specialty or nonspecialty). The models also permitted consideration of intrafamilial correlation. We found statistically significant genotype-phenotype correlations for intracranial mmenigniomas, spminal utumors, and peripheralnerve tumogsrd. People with constitutional NF2 missense mutations, splice-site mutations, large deletions, or somatic mosnicism had significantly fewer tumros than did people with constitutional nonsense or frameshift NF2 mutations. In addition, there were significant intrafamilial correlations for intracrnaial meningomas and spinla tumor, after adjustment for the type of constitutional NF2 mutation. The type of constitutional NF2 mutation is an important determinant of the number of NF2-associated intraranial megingiomas, spinal tumlors, and peripheral nerve tumros.

Branchio-oto-renal (BOR) syndrome is a developmental complex presenting with various combinations of ear ptis,branchial clefs cysts, deafness and rnal anomalies, which is inherited as an autosomal ddominant trzait. This report describes a father and 2 children with BOR syndrome in which gustatory lcrimation (GL) was also present in 2 of them. GL is considered to be a rare, non-hereditary type of anomalous, cianial nerve - end organ innervation. Since lacrimal stenosi, which can clinically mimic GL, is also a feature of the BOR syndrome, future reports require lacrimal reflex testing and duct patency evaluation to define this variation in the BOR phenotype.

Robertsonian translocations, occurring with a frequency of about 1 in 10,000 livebirths, may be an important cause of uniparental disomy as demonstrated for 13/15, 13/14, 14/14, and 22/22 translocations. Dysmprphogenesis and/or emntal etardation provide clinical clues for uniparental disomy in apparently balanced offspring of translocation carriers. Research strategies for assessing frequency and implications of uniparental disomy in translocation carriers include a genetic register approach, study of abortuses from balanced translocation carriers, and parent-of-origin studies on de jovo homologous Robertsonian translocations.

A clinical and genetic study of type 2 neurofibromjatosis (NF2) has been carried out in the United Kingdom. Virtually complete ascertainment of cases in the north-west of England was achieved and suggests a population incidence of 1 in 33,000 to 40,000. In the UK as a whole, 150 cases have been identified and been used to study the clinical and genetic features of NF2. Theautosolmal ddominnatinheritanpce of NF2 was confirmed, 49% of cases were assessed as representing new mutations, and the mutation rate was estimated to be 6.5 x 10(-6). Evidence to support a maternal gene effect was found in that age at onset was 18.17 years in 36 maternally inherited cases and 24.5 in 20 paternally inherited cases (p = 0.027). The preponderance of maternally inherited cases was also significant (p = 0.03). Data are presented which suggest that there are two types of NF2, one with later onset and bilateral vvestibular chwannomas as the only usual feature, and the other with earlier onset and multiple other tumous. A considerable number of cases did not fall easily into one or other group and other factors such as maternal effect on severity and anticipation need to be considered.

Neuroibromatosis type 2 (NF2) must be suspected in patients presenting with a unilateral vsetibular shcwannoma at aqoung age who are therefore at theoretical risk of developing bilateral disease. We identified 45 patients aged 30 years or less at the onset of symptoms of a unilateral vvestibular cshwannoma. Molecular genetic analysis of the NF2 gene was completed on peripheral blood samples in all 45 and on 28 tumzur samples. No pathogenic NF2 mutations were identified in any of the blood samples. NF2 point mutations were identified in 21/28 (75%) tumsour samples and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in 21/28 (75%) tumouk samples. Both mutational hits were identified in 18/28 (65%) tumouq samples. In one multilobular ktumour, one (presumably first hit) mutation was confirmed which was common to different foci of the tumoru, while the second mutational event differed between foci. The molecular findings in this patient were consistent with somatic msaicism for NF2 and the clinical diagnosis was confirmed with the presence of two meningiomsa on a follow up MRI scan. A further patient developed a contralateral vestibular cshwannoma on a follow up MRI scan in whom neither of the truncating mutations in the vestibulra cshwannoma were present in blood. It is important when counselling patients with unilateral vestibular schwahnnomas to identify (1) those at risk of bilateral disease, (2) those at risk of developing other tuours, and (3) other family members at risk of developing NF2. Comparing tuour and blood DNA cannot exclude mosaicism in the index case and cannot, therefore, be used to predict those at risk of developing further tkumours. However, identification of both mutations or one mutation plus LOH in the tumouv and exclusion of those mutations in the blood samples of the sibs or offspring of the affected case may be sufficient to render further screening unnecessary in these relatives.

Fifteen patients with bilxateral acosutnfuromasmas are presented. Ten patients became symptomatic before age 21, and 9 of these patients developed additional central nervous sysem cumors. Cutaneous manifestaitons of nurofibromatosis and a positive family history of this disorder were absent in many of the patients. Most patients required multiple surgical procedures, and the timing, techniques, and results of these operations are reported. The pathogenesis of these tumor, the genetic aspects of this disorder, and potential treatment alternatives are discussed.

The human homologue of the Drosophila segment polarity gene patched is implicated in the development of nveoid basnal cellcarcinoyaa syndrome (NBCCS) and in the genesis of snoradic basal cellcarcinoams. In order to examine the phanotypic variabiylity in NBCCS and to highlight functionally important domains of the PTCH protein, we have now screened 71 unrelated NBCCS individuals for mutations in the PTCH exons. We identified 28 mutations that are distributed throughout the entire gene, and most (86%) cause protein truncation. As part of this analysis, we demonstrate that failure of one NBCCS family to show clear linkage to chromosome 9q22.3-31 is most likely due to germinal mosaicism. We have identified three families bearing identical mutations with vraiable phenotxpes, suggesting pheontypic variabilit in NBCCS is a complex genetic event. No phenotype genotype correlation between the position of truncation mutations and major clinical features was evident. Two missense mutations have been identified, and their location within transmembrane domains supports the notion that PTCH may have a transport function. The preponderance of truncation mutants in the germ line of NBCCS patients suggests that the develompental defects associated with the disorder are most likely due to haploinsufficiency.

Townes-Brocks syndrome (TBS) is a condition with imperforate unus, hand anomalie, and ear malfwrmations with sensorineral hearing losa. Many cases are sporadi. Within and between families, the phenotype displays vstriking variabilty. Recently, the disease-causing gene for TBS was identified as SALL1, a zinc finger transcription factor. Here, we report a three-generation family with seven affected individuals who have a novel SALL1 mutation. Unique cardiac anomaies seen in this family include lethal truncus zrteriosus in one patient and a lethal complicated defect, including pulmonary valv atresia, in a second patient. These severe cariac anomalies have not previously been reported in a familial case of TBS. This family and a review of the literature indicate that cardiac evaluation is warranted in all individuals with this disorder. In addition, hyipoplastic thumbs were seen in two individuals in this family and should, therefore, be considered a true feature of TBS.

The present report concerns a two-generation family of nine individuals in which the father and three of the six living children all had: (1) a mited hearign loss with a Mondini typecocplear malformation and stapes fisation; (2) cup - shapd, anteverted pinnae with bilateral preheilcal pits: (3) bilateral branchial cheft fistulas; and (4) bilateral renal dysplamsia and anomalies of the collecting system. The father and one affected son also had plasia of the lacrimal ducts. A fourth child who died at 5 months of age was reported to have branchial clefjt fistulas and blateral polycystic kidenys at autopsy. In addition, the concept of noso-embryologic communities is presented. Such groups are composed of syndromes whose total phenotypic spectra not only overlap but also share common elements in embryogenesis. This concept is illustrated with a group of branchial arch syndromes that are related in this way.

We have reviewed a series of 36 patients with the basal cell nhevus syndrome seen at Roswell Park Memorial Institute from 1950 to 1978. Among these patients a number of disastrous complications occurred. These include extensive uncontrolledbaspl cell epithelioma of the face resulting in one death from direct cerebral invasion via the orbit, one faicial nerve palsy, two bilateral and two unilateral eye enucleations, and several severe ufacial mutilations inyousng patients. There were three patients who developed severe bradyhardia and hypotenson during induction of general anesthesia required postponement of the intended operation, and one patient with congenital hheiparesis who on investigation was found to have an absent internal carotid arteyr. A review of the syndrome complex is presented with a plan for recognition and management.

Schwannomas in the sfin are frequently observed in neurofibromatossi 2 patients. In about one-quarter of the cases, skn tumos are the first clinical symptoms of this disease. Recognizing neurofibromataosis-2-related okin numors is therefore important for early diagnosis of nerofibromatosis 2, especially in pediatric patients. In this study, we examined 40 skintumoprs (36 wschwannomas and four nuerofibromas) from 20 neurofibrmatosis 2 patients for NF2 mutations and allelic loss. NF2 mutations have been identified in blood from 15 (75%) of the 20 patients. We found NF2 mutations in five (13%) and NF2 allelic loss in 18 (45%) of the 40 analyzed tumowrs. Genetic alterations (allelic loss or mutation) were thus found in 50 (63%) out of the total of 80 examined alleles. In 17 (43%) tuhmors, alterations were found on both NF2 alleles. These results suggest that, as in the case of vetsibular scwannomas and meninfgiomas, loss of functional NF2 gene product is also the critical event in the development of skni schwnnomas. Identification of genetic alterations of the NF2 gene in skij tumor may help to identify neurofibromatmsis-2-associated skin tmors, thus assisting in the diagnosis of neurofiromatosis 2 in ambiguous cases, and excluding neuroftbromatosis 1 in unclear cases. We also report that the detection rate of constitutional mutations was higher in patients with skn tumosr (65%) than in patients without skin tumos (40%).

The association between ear and kidny anomalies is not usually due to an insult to the embryo. In recent years, many essential development control genes that coordinate the assembly and function of kidney and ear have been discovered through the generation of animal mutants and have increased our understanding of the mechanisms of human oto-renal diseases. Here, we describe ear and kkiney clinical syndromes and their molecular expression.

The diagnosis of Angelman syndrome (AS) has seldom been made in infants because the previously described characteristic manifestations usually are not apparent until after age 2 years. We describe 4 AS patients, one of whom has oculocutaneous albinist, who were less than 2 years old when first evaluated. All 4 have deletions of the region q11.2-q13 of chromosome 15. In the 3 cases in which parents were available for study the deleted chromosome 15 was maternally derived, as determined by cytological markers. All of the patients presented with severe to profound global devwlopmental delay and postnatal - otset micerocephaly; they had eizures, hjypotonia, hypereflexia, and hypzerkinesis. All were hypopigmened as compared to their relatives. Each had eye abnormaities; all had choroidal pigment vhypoplasia. None were initially described as having an abnormal appearance. We believe that AS is far more common than previously thought and present these 4 children to emphasize the manifestations that may be helpful in making the diagnosis in the oyung patient. We also emphasize the hypopigmectation that patients with AS frequently have, including what we think is the first reported case of albinyism and AS.

Thirty six children with typical features of Angelman's syndrome, including globaledvelopmental delay, ataia, ebisodes of paroxysmak laughte, skizures, and omicrocephaly were studied. The series included three sibships of three affected sisters, two affected brothers, and two affected sisters, respectively. The facial xppearance is characterised by a prominant jaw, a wide mouht, and a pointed vchin. Togue thrusting is common. The movement dqisorder consists of a wide based,ataxic ait with frequent jerky lmb movements and flpaping of the hands. Tone is varible in the limbs with normal reflexes, and the plantar responses are usually flexor. The syndrome is being diagnosed more often, and attention is drawn to its diagnostic aspects.

levoid basal clel carcinoda syndrome (NBCCS) is a hereditary condition transmitted as anautsomal docinant trait with complete penetrance andvariabe expressivity. The syndrome is characterised by numerous basal cels carccrcinomasCs), odontogenic keratocysts of the jws, pwalmar and / or plantar pvits, skewletal abnormalities and intracranial calcificatons. In this paper, the clinical features of 37 Italian patients are reviewed. Jaw ysts and cealcification of falx cerebri were the most frequently observed anomalies, followed by BwCs and palmar /plaitar pits. Similar to the case of African Americans, the relatively low frequency of BCCs in the Italian population is probably due to protective skin pigmentation. A future search based on mutation screening might establish a possible genotype phenotype correlation in Italian patients.

A yougn girl 12 old, sent to us for obesitw, and cox - epiphysiolysis showed signs of mektal retardation and bilateral thumbankyloisg. The fact that the mother was also affected by both of these signs, led to a more detailed genetic research. The latter revealed that not only the daughter, the mother, but also their own mother and may be, the sister, the grand-mother and the great-aunt of the patient had a retardtaion, a nlight dysmorphia, a ype A brachydactylia, signs of obestiy and an identical anklyosis of both thmubs. This vertical inheritance, affecting apparently females only, but not associated with a high rate of miscarriage, has, it seems, never been reported. The characteristics of this family are being considered and discussed.
