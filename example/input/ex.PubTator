10617681|t|Possible role of valvular serotonin 5-HT(2B) receptors in the cardiopathy associated with fenfluramine.
10617681|a|Dexfenfluramine was approved in the United States for long-term use as an appetite suppressant until it was reported to be associated with valvular heart disease. The valvular changes (myofibroblast proliferation) are histopathologically indistinguishable from those observed in carcinoid disease or after long-term exposure to 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)(2)-preferring ergot drugs (ergotamine, methysergide). 5-HT(2) receptor stimulation is known to cause fibroblast mitogenesis, which could contribute to this lesion. To elucidate the mechanism of "fen-phen"-associated valvular lesions, we examined the interaction of fenfluramine and its metabolite norfenfluramine with 5-HT(2) receptor subtypes and examined the expression of these receptors in human and porcine heart valves. Fenfluramine binds weakly to 5-HT(2A), 5-HT(2B), and 5-HT(2C) receptors. In contrast, norfenfluramine exhibited high affinity for 5-HT(2B) and 5-HT(2C) receptors and more moderate affinity for 5-HT(2A) receptors. In cells expressing recombinant 5-HT(2B) receptors, norfenfluramine potently stimulated the hydrolysis of inositol phosphates, increased intracellular Ca(2+), and activated the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade, the latter of which has been linked to mitogenic actions of the 5-HT(2B) receptor. The level of 5-HT(2B) and 5-HT(2A) receptor transcripts in heart valves was at least 300-fold higher than the levels of 5-HT(2C) receptor transcript, which were barely detectable. We propose that preferential stimulation of valvular 5-HT(2B) receptors by norfenfluramine, ergot drugs, or 5-HT released from carcinoid tumors (with or without accompanying 5-HT(2A) receptor activation) may contribute to valvular fibroplasia in humans.

20921890|t|An open-label tolerability study of BL-1020 antipsychotic: a novel gamma aminobutyric acid ester of perphenazine.
20921890|a|BACKGROUND: BL-1020, a novel gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) ester of perphenazine, is a new oral antipsychotic with a strong affinity for dopamine and serotonin receptors. Unlike first- and second-generation antipsychotics, it has agonist activity at GABA(A). OBJECTIVE: This is the first study to examine tolerability and safety of BL-1020 in schizophrenia. METHODS: This was a phase-II, open-label, multicenter, 6-week study treating patients (n = 36) with chronic schizophrenia. Dosing started at 20 mg/d and increased over 7 days to 40 mg/d. Weekly assessments were conducted. RESULTS: All but 1 patient was titrated to 30 mg/d at day 4; on day 7, 30 were titrated to 40 mg/d. Four patients discontinued the study prematurely. There was no clinically relevant increase in vital signs, sedation, dizziness, or other central nervous system effects or electrocardiogram or laboratory abnormalities and a small increase in weight. Ten patients experienced extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) requiring treatment with an anticholinergic; 4 patients were unable to reach maximum dose because of EPS. Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale did not indicate clinically significant changes in EPS. The most common adverse event was insomnia (6 patients); other frequent adverse effects (all n = 3) were extrapyramidal disorder, headache, parkinsonism, tremor, and hyperprolactinemia. There was improvement on Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and Clinical Global Impression of Change with 22 patients showing at least 20% decrease by end point on Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and 31 patients showing at least minimal improvement on Clinical Global Impression of Change. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that 20 to 40 mg/d of BL-1020 is associated with clinically relevant improvement of psychosis with no worsening of EPS and support further testing in randomized controlled trials.

1003450|t|A syndrome of brachydactyly (absence of some middle or distal phalanges), aplastic or hypoplastic nails, symphalangism (ankylois of proximal interphalangeal joints), synostosis of some carpal and tarsal bones, craniosynostosis, and dysplastic hip joints is reported in five members of an Italian family.
1003450|a| It may represent a previously undescribed autosomal dominant trait.

10066029|t|Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS) is a hereditary condition transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait with complete penetrance and variable expressivity.
10066029|a|The syndrome is characterised by numerous basal cell carcinomas (BCCs), odontogenic keratocysts of the jaws, palmar and/or plantar pits, skeletal abnormalities and intracranial calcifications. In this paper, the clinical features of 37 Italian patients are reviewed. Jaw cysts and calcification of falx cerebri were the most frequently observed anomalies, followed by BCCs and palmar/plantar pits. Similar to the case of African Americans, the relatively low frequency of BCCs in the Italian population is probably due to protective skin pigmentation. A future search based on mutation screening might establish a possible genotype phenotype correlation in Italian patients.
